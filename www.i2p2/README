To run locally (for testing purposes):

$ python app.py
This will run a webserver on http://localhost:5009/

If you get python import errors when trying to run the local web server, you
might need to install required dependencies: jinja and werkzeug. If you are
using Linux, they might be in the repository of your distribution. Otherwise
you will have to install them yourself. Please see the homepages of these
projects:

http://jinja.pocoo.org/
http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/
