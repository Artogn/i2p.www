<p>00:00 &lt;@nop&gt; hi
<p>00:00 &lt; Debrys&gt; greetings
<p>00:00 &lt; case&gt; hallo
<p>00:00 &lt;@nop&gt; hi
<p>00:00 &lt; Bouris&gt; Hi.
<p>00:00 &lt; MrEcho&gt; hey case
<p>00:00 &lt;@nop&gt; meeting started
<p>00:00 &lt; case&gt; sup echo
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; nop: agenda please
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; ok
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; I thought you had it
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; 1) welcome
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; 1) Welcome
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; 2) Normal stuff
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; 3) Questions
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; sure that works
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; welcome to the nth IIP-dev meeting
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; 2) Normal stuff, i.e. IIP update
<p>00:01 &lt;@nop&gt; ok
<p>00:02 &lt;@nop&gt; we're working on getting rc3 changed to 1.1 final
<p>00:02 &lt;@nop&gt; I think all that's left is some path fix bugs
<p>00:02 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah made the patch for -h, nop is reviewing it
<p>00:02 &lt;@nop&gt; yes
<p>00:02 &lt;@nop&gt; actually he can commit, I'll let him know, forgot to email him
<p>00:02 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:02 &lt;@nop&gt; also
<p>00:02 &lt;@mids&gt; then we just got to check how the other reported bug is
<p>00:03 &lt;@nop&gt; Hezekiah has successfully compiled a version of IIP with the GNU Multi Precision library
<p>00:03 &lt;@nop&gt; and it was a success
<p>00:03 &lt; MrEcho&gt; cool
<p>00:03 &lt;@nop&gt; the crypto speed was improved
<p>00:03 &lt;@nop&gt; so that will be something we do for 1.2
<p>00:03 &lt;@nop&gt; 1.2 is focusing on standards as well, standardized crypto engine and big number routines
<p>00:03 &lt;@nop&gt; etc
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; there is our hero!
<p>00:04 -!- mode/#iip-dev [+o hezekiah] by mids
<p>00:04 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Who?
<p>00:04 &lt;@nop&gt; you
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; you!
<p>00:04 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Sorry I'm late. :)
<p>00:04 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (And thanks for the compliment.)
<p>00:06 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Did I miss the meeting? ... or is it still going?
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; nop was just telling about the update works
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; and that you can commit the -h patch
<p>00:06 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; OK.
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; then we got to see how severe the problems with the file paths are
<p>00:06 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I just got through reading the logs.
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; test in multiple locations etc
<p>00:06 &lt; MrEcho&gt; anything new for windows users?
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; platofrms I mean
<p>00:08 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, the -h bugfix might affect the windows users. I'm not sure if it was a problem over there.
<p>00:09 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; As for the GnuMP implementation of BigNum, that should be part of the 1.2 release for windows (though it might take some work to get it to run on windows.)
<p>00:09 &lt; Debrys&gt; may i ask what this BigNum-stuff is all about?
<p>00:10 &lt; case&gt; what version of libgmp was it dones with?
<p>00:10 &lt; case&gt; er 
<p>00:10 &lt; case&gt; dones/done
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, since mids and nop seem to have dissapeared for the moment, I'll explain it while we wait for them to get back.
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; OK.
<p>00:10 &lt;@mids&gt; I am listening
<p>00:10 &lt;@mids&gt; please entertain
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; First I'll answer case's question because it is simple. I used version 4.1 of GnuMP.
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (Gentoo doesn't have 4.1.2 yet.)
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Next is Debrys question:
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; BigNum structure with a is a bunch of functions used in the isproxy source code.
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; It is basically just a way to make integers that are REALLY REALLY big.
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Obviously modern CPU's don't offer really really big integer types, so C doesn't have them.
<p>00:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; ... and crypto needs to use really big numbers.
<p>00:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Thus, an implementation of a "BigNum" is needed.
<p>00:12 &lt; Debrys&gt; i think i got it :) thank you
<p>00:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Currently, we have 2 implentations of BigNum: one in SSL and one in GnuMP.
<p>00:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; You're welcome. :)
<p>00:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Back to you, mids. :)
<p>00:12 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:12  * hezekiah hands the microphone back.
<p>00:13 &lt;@mids&gt; I am done on point 2
<p>00:13 &lt;@mids&gt; lets go to the question round
<p>00:13 &lt;@mids&gt; questions?
<p>00:13 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (oh, the irony.) ;-)
<p>00:13 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Yeah. Are we almost to 1.1 release yet?
<p>00:14 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; What still needs to be done? (Besides get codeshark to make a tarball.)
<p>00:14 &lt;@mids&gt; testing if files are stored in the right directories
<p>00:14 &lt;@mids&gt; in every case
<p>00:15 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: please tell  me if you did commit the -h thing, then I'll put the bug item closed
<p>00:15 &lt;@nop&gt; oh hezekiah you can commit
<p>00:15 &lt;@nop&gt; the -h thing
<p>00:15 &lt;@nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:15 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I haven't commited the -h thing yet.
<p>00:15 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I don't know what branch to commit to. :)
<p>00:15 &lt;@nop&gt; he does now ;)
<p>00:16 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Give me a minute and I
<p>00:16 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I'll update the bugfix.
<p>00:16 &lt; Debrys&gt; hmm, what will be new or changed in 1.1? not too much into detail - just in general
<p>00:16 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; 1. Bugfixes! :)
<p>00:17 &lt;@mids&gt; 2. more bugfixe
<p>00:17 &lt; Debrys&gt; lol
<p>00:17 &lt;@nop&gt; debrys no major changes
<p>00:17 &lt; Debrys&gt; anything which makes the connections more stable?
<p>00:17 &lt;@nop&gt; just bug fixes
<p>00:18 &lt;@mids&gt; Debrys: we will try that with a more minimum node.ref in the initial distribution
<p>00:18 &lt; Debrys&gt; i did a.......... rather unelegant hack to the node.ref..........
<p>00:19 &lt; Debrys&gt; only the invisiblenet relays.......... no update of node.ref
<p>00:19 &lt; Debrys&gt; i havent ping-timeout'ed for days........
<p>00:19 &lt; Debrys&gt; before of that i god disconnected in 30min intervals on average
<p>00:20 &lt; Debrys&gt; but its not a very good solution :)
<p>00:21 &lt; Debrys&gt; also.......... on the floppy-disk thing........
<p>00:21 &lt; Debrys&gt; i asked someone if he would do a hack for me on the boxedIRC-Source......
<p>00:22 &lt; Debrys&gt; if he accepts, this means i would have an 120kb IRC-Client which doesn't need any installation and saves all its settings in a ini-file on the disk
<p>00:23 &lt;@mids&gt; nice
<p>00:23 &lt;@mids&gt; keep us informed please
<p>00:23 &lt; Debrys&gt; if this works, there will not only be IIP and a IRC-Client on the disk, but also an email-client...... and i'm trying to get a PGP-App on it too........... maybe also a messenger client :)
<p>00:23 &lt; Debrys&gt; I'll do :)
<p>00:23 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; sound nice.
<p>00:23 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; [ sounds even. ]
<p>00:24 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:24 &lt;@mids&gt; more things?
<p>00:24 &lt; Debrys&gt; nope
<p>00:25  * mids searches for his meeting-hammer
<p>00:25 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Almost got the patch up, mids.
<p>00:25 &lt;@mids&gt; hurray
<p>00:25 &lt;@mids&gt; *baff*
<p>00:25 &lt;@mids&gt; meeting closed
<p>00:25 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; lol.
<p>00:25 &lt; Debrys&gt; :)
