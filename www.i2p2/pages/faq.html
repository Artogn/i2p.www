<h3 id="reseed">My router has been up for several minutes and has zero or very few connections
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#reseed">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
   The reseed URL has changed. If this is your first install, you must change it and then
   click "Reseed" on the console to find other routers.
   After your router is running,
   on <a href="http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp">configadvanced.jsp</a>,
   add the line <tt>i2p.reseedURL=http://i2pdb.tin0.de/netDb/</tt> ,
   then click "Apply", then click the "Reseed" link on the left.
</p>

<h3 id="exit">Is my router an "exit node" to the regular internet? I don't want it to be.
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#exit">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
   No. Unlike tor, "exit nodes" or "outproxies" are not an inherent part of the network.
   Only volunteers who set up and run separate applications will relay traffic to the regular internet.
   There are very very few of these.
</p>

<h3 id="outproxy">I can't access regular internet sites through I2P.
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#outproxy">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
   See above. There are very few HTTP "outproxies", they are not an inherent part of the network,
   and they may not be up.
   In addition, the old outproxy squid.i2p has vanished.
   The only outproxies at the moment are true.i2p and krabs.i2p.
   To use these, <a href="http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/edit.jsp?tunnel=0">edit your i2ptunnel setting</a>
   and set your outproxy list to 'true.i2p,krabs.i2p'.
   If it doesn't work, they are not up. It is not I2P's fault.
</p>

<h3 id="down">Most of the eepsites within I2P are down?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#down">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
   If you consider every eepsite that has ever been created, yes, most of them are down.
   People and eepsites come and go.
   A good way to get started in I2P is check out a list of eepsites that are currently up.
   <a href="http://inproxy.tino.i2p/status.php">inproxy.tino.i2p</a> and
   <a href="http://perv.i2p/stats.cgi">perv.i2p</a> track active eepsites.
</p>

<h3 id="myeepsite">How do I set up my own eepsite?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#myeepsite">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
   Click on the <a href="http://localhost:7658/">My Eepsite Link</a>
   on the top of your router console for instructions.
</p>

<h3 id="slow">Why is I2P so slow?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#slow">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
Why are downloads, torrents, web browsing, and everything else so slow on I2P?
The encryption and routing within the I2P network adds a substantial amount of overhead and limits bandwidth.
Anonymity isn't free.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you and everybody else probably need to increase your bandwidth limits.
Two key settings are the inbound and outbund bandwidth limiters on 
<a href="http://localhost:7657/config.jsp">the configuration page</a>.
With the default settings of 16KBps you will generally get no better than 5KBps data transfer in I2PSnark.
Increasing the settings (but keeping within your actual connection limitations)
will increase the potential transfer rate for I2PSnark and all other applications.

<h3 id="irc">How do I connect to IRC within I2P?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#irc">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
On the
<a href="http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/index.jsp">I2PTunnel configuration page</a>,
start the ircProxy.
Then tell your IRC client to connect to localhost port 6668.

<h3 id="remote_webconsole">How can I access the web console from my other machines or password protect it?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#remote_webconsole">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
    For security purposes, the router's admin console by default only listens
    for connections on the local interface.  However, with a little hacking,
    you can make it reachable remotely:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up clients.config and replace<br />
    <code>clientApp.0.args=7657 127.0.0.1 ./webapps/</code><br />
    with <br />
    <code>clientApp.0.args=7657 0.0.0.0 ./webapps/</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp">http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp</a>
    and add a new option: <code>consolePassword=foo</code> (or whatever password you want)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">http://localhost:7657/index.jsp</a>
    and hit "Graceful restart", which restarts the JVM and reloads the client applications</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After that fires up, you should now be able to reach your console remotely.
    You will be prompted for a username and password though - the username is
    "admin" and the password is whatever you specified in step 2 above.  Note: the
    <code>0.0.0.0</code> above specifies an <i>interface</i>, not a network or netmask.  0.0.0.0
    means "bind to all interfaces", so it can be reachable on 127.0.0.1:7657 as well as
    any LAN/WAN IP.
</p>

<h3 id="eepsite">Whats an "eepsite"?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#eepsite">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
	An eepsite is a website that is hosted anonymously - you can access it by
	setting your web browser's HTTP proxy to use the web proxy (typically it
	listens on localhost port 4444), and browsing to the site.
</p>

<h3 id="active">What do the Active x/y numbers mean in the router console?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#active">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
    x is the number of peers you've sent or received a message from
    successfully in the last minute, y is the number of peers seen in the last
    hour or so.
</p>

<h3 id="socks">Is it possible to use I2P as a socks proxy?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#socks">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
    While it would be technically feasible, many applications leak sensitive
    information that could identify you on the internet. I2P only filters
    connection data, but if the programme you intend to run sends this
    information as content, I2P has no way to protect your anonymity.  For
    example, some mail applications will send the IP address of the machine
    they are running on to a mail server. There is no way for I2P to filter
    this, thus using I2P to 'socksify' existing applications is possible, but
    extremely dangerous.
</p>

<h3 id="ports">What ports does I2P use?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#ports">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
	Ok, here's a rundown of the default ports (everything is configurable
	through various settings, of course):
</p>

<p>
	<ul><p>
		<li><b>Internet-facing ports</b>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Outbound UDP from port 8887 to arbitrary remote UDP ports, allowing replies</b></li>
		<li><b>Outbound TCP from random high ports to arbitrary remote TCP ports</b></li>
		<li><b>(optional, but recommended) Inbound UDP to port 8887 from arbitrary locations</b></li>
		<li><b>(optional, but recommended) Inbound TCP to port 8887 from arbitrary locations</b><br />
			By default, I2P does not listen for inbound TCP connections.<br />
			To start accepting them, you can either tell I2P to autodetect its address and port<br />
			using the UDP transport, or you can manually enter an IP address (or DNS name)<br />
			and a TCP port. You can activate this feature on the Configuration page.</li>
		<li><b>Outbound UDP on port 123, allowing replies</b><br />
			This is necessary for I2P's internal time sync (via SNTP - 
			querying a random SNTP host in pool.ntp.org or another
			server you specify)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</p></ul>

	<ul><p>
		<li><b>Local I2P ports</b>, listening only to local connections by default:
		<ul>
			<li><b>7654:</b> I2P Client Protocol port, used by client apps</li>
			<li><b>7656:</b> SAM bridge, a higher level socket API for clients</li>
			<li><b>7657:</b> your router console</li>
			<li><b>7658:</b> your eepsite</li>
			<li><b>32000:</b> local control channel for the service wrapper</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</p></ul>

	<ul><p>
		<li><b>Default I2PTunnel ports</b>, listening only to local connections by default:
		<ul>
			<li><b>2401:</b> cvs.i2p (disabled by default)</li>
			<li><b>4444:</b> HTTP proxy</li>
			<li><b>6668:</b> round robin across the irc2p IRC network</li>
			<li><b>7659:</b> smtp.postman.i2p</li>
			<li><b>7660:</b> pop.postman.i2p</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</p></ul>
</p>

<p>
	The local I2P ports and the I2PTunnel ports do not need to be reachable from 
	remote machines, but *should* be reachable locally.  You can also create 
	additional ports for I2PTunnel instances via http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/ 
	(and in turn, would need to get your firewall to allow you local access, but 
	not remote access, unless desired).
</p>

<p>
	So, to summarize, nothing needs to be reachable by unsolicted remote peers, but
	if you can configure your NAT/firewall to allow inbound UDP to port 8887, you'll
	get better performance.  You will also need to be able to send outbound UDP packets
	to arbitrary remote peers (blocking IPs randomly with something like PeerGuardian
	only hurts you - don't do it).
</p>

<h3 id="ports">How do I reseed manually?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#manual_reseed">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
	An I2P router only needs to reseed once, to join the network for the first time.
	Reseeding is nothing more than sending plain HTTP GET requests
	to fetch a directory listing and download multiple "routerInfo" files
	from a predefined reseed URL.
</p>

<p>
	A typical symptom of a failed reseed is the "Known" indicator
	(on the left sidebar of the router console) displaying a very small value
	(often less than 5) which does not increase. This can occur, among other things,
	if your firewall limits outbound traffic, and blocked the reseed request.
</p>

<p>
	To reseed an I2P router manually, do the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Stop your I2P router</li>
	<li>Open <a href="http://i2pdb.tin0.de/netDb/">http://i2pdb.tin0.de/netDb/</a> using a web browser</li>
	<li>Save a dozen "routerInfo" files to your I2P "netDb" directory (ignore the "leaseSet" files)</li>
	<li>Start your I2P router</li>
	</ul>
</p>
