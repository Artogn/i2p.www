<h3>Post-install work</h3>

<p>After running the installer on windows, simply click on the "Start I2P" button
which will bring up the <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">router console</a>,
which has further instructions.</p>

<p>On Unix-like systems, I2P can be started as a service
using the "i2prouter" script, located in the directory you selected for I2P.
Changing to that directory in a console and issuing "sh i2prouter status"
should tell you the router's status. The arguments "start", "stop" and "restart"
control the service. The <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">router console</a>
can be accessed at its usual location.
For users on OpenSolaris and other systems for which the wrapper (i2psvc) is not supported,
start the router with "sh runplain.sh" instead.
</p>

<p>When installing for the first time, please remember to <b>adjust your NAT/firewall</b>
if you can, bearing in mind the Internet-facing ports I2P uses,
<a href="faq#ports">described here</a> among other ports.
If you have successfully opened your port to inbound TCP, also enable inbound TCP on the
<a href="http://localhost:7657/config.jsp">configuration page</a>.
</p>

<p>Also, please review and <b>adjust the bandwidth settings</b> on the
<a href="http://localhost:7657/config.jsp">configuration page</a>,
as the default settings of 96 KBps down / 40 KBps up are fairly slow.
</p>

<h3>Updates from earlier releases:</h3>
<p>
Both automatic and manual upgrades are available for the release.
</p><p>
If you are running 0.7.5 or later, your router should detect the
new release. To upgrade simply click the 'Download Update' button on your router console
when it appears.
</p><p>
If you are running 0.7.4 or earlier, please see
<a href=release-0.7.5.html>the 0.7.5 release notes</a>
for important information about how to configure your router to automatically
receive the release.
</p><p>
If you are running 0.6.1.30 or earlier, please see
<a href=upgrade-0.6.1.30.html>instructions</a>
for important information about how to configure your router to automatically
receive the release.
</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have reconfigured your router following the <a href=upgrade-0.6.1.30.html>instructions</a>, you should see a link on your 
    <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">router console</a> allowing
    you to download and install the new release by just clicking on that
    link.</li>
<li>Alternately, you can use the manual method specified below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Updates from earlier releases (manual method):</h3>
