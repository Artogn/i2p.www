<h3>Post-install work</h3>

<p>After running the installer on windows, simply click on the "Run I2P" button
which will bring up the <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">router console</a>,
which has further instructions.</p>

<p>On Unix-like systems, I2P can be started as a service
using the "i2prouter" script, located in the directory you selected for I2P.
Changing to that directory in a console and issuing "sh i2prouter status"
should tell you the router's status. The arguments "start", "stop" and "restart"
control the service. The <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">router console</a>
can be accessed at its usual location.
For users on OpenSolaris and other systems for which the wrapper (i2psvc) is not supported,
start the router with "sh runplain.sh" instead.
</p>

<p>When installing for the first time, please remember to <b>adjust your NAT/firewall</b>
if you can, bearing in mind the Internet-facing ports I2P uses,
<a href="http://www.i2p2.de/faq#ports">described here</a> among other ports.
If you have successfully opened your port to inbound TCP, also enable inbound TCP on the
<a href="http://localhost:7657/config.jsp">configuration page</a>.
</p>

<p>Also, please review and <b>adjust the bandwidth settings</b> on the
<a href="http://localhost:7657/config.jsp">configuration page</a>,
as the default settings of 32 KBps down / 16 KBps up are fairly slow.
</p>

<h3>Updates from earlier releases:</h3>
<p>
Both automatic and manual upgrades are available for the release.
</p><p>
If you are running 0.6.1.31, your router should detect the
new release, to upgrade simply click the 'Update Available' link on your router console
when it appears.
</p><p>
If you are running 0.6.1.30 or earlier, please see
<a href=upgrade-0.6.1.30.html>instructions</a>
for important information about how to configure your router to automatically
receive the release.
</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have configured your router following the instructions above, you should see a link on your 
    <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">router console</a> allowing
    you to download and install the new release by just clicking on that
    link.</li>
<li>Alternately, you can use the instructions specified below.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Updates from earlier releases (manual method):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://mirror.i2p2.de/i2pupdate_0.6.1.32.zip">i2pupdate_0.6.1.32.zip</a>
    (SHA1
5b3157096ac5a7af81e9b0555aadc7738c22d79d
     <a href="http://mirror.i2p2.de/i2pupdate_0.6.1.32.zip.sig">sig</a>) to your I2P 
    installation directory and rename as i2pupdate.zip.
    (alternately, you can get the source as above and run "ant updater", then copy the
    resulting i2pupdate.zip to your I2P installation directory).  You do 
    NOT need to unzip that file.</li>
<li>Click <a href="http://localhost:7657/configservice.jsp">"Graceful restart"</a></li>
<li>Grab a cup of coffee and come back in 11 minutes</li>
