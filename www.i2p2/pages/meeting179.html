<p>16:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>16:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; 1) Net status and 0.6.1.18</p>
<p>16:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; 2) baz</p>
<p>16:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; 3) ???</p>
<p>16:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>16:31  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>16:32 &lt; jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-May/001288.html</p>
<p>16:32 &lt; jrandom&gt; while y'all read through that, lets jump on in to 1) Net status and 0.6.1.18</p>
<p>16:33 &lt; jrandom&gt; the past week has been pretty bumpy on irc & the net in general</p>
<p>16:33 &lt;+Complication&gt; Watching the graphs, but haven't noticed a perceivable change yet</p>
<p>16:33 &lt;+Complication&gt; Only the beginning too, of course</p>
<p>16:34 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, its only been a few hours, with under 20% of the net upgraded</p>
<p>16:35 &lt; jrandom&gt; there are still a few big guns left to deploy on the net, but I'd like things to stabilize first before pushing out major changes</p>
<p>16:35 &lt;+Complication&gt; Indeed, it helps to see (as much as seeing is possible) what changes what, and in which direction</p>
<p>16:36 &lt;+Complication&gt; If one deploys everything at once, figuring out what worked may be very tough</p>
<p>16:38 &lt; tmp&gt; *sigh* </p>
<p>16:38  * tmp dreams of IRC stability.</p>
<p>16:39 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, on all fronts ;)</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;roderick_spod1&gt; Roderick dreams of big tits.</p>
<p>16:39 &lt; jrandom&gt; (this is why we can filter the meeting logs... ;)</p>
<p>16:40 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 1) Net status and 0.6.1.18?</p>
<p>16:41 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets hop on over to 2) </p>
<p>16:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; not much more to add here, just giving a status update on some w32/w64 support</p>
<p>16:43 &lt; jrandom&gt; as mentioned in the mail, gcj doesn't really seem viable on mingw atm, though we might be able to pull some tricks</p>
<p>16:44 &lt; jrandom&gt; there is an older 3.4.4/3.4.5 gcj that works on mingw, but the classpath suport in there is pretty old.</p>
<p>16:45 &lt; jrandom&gt; (and even after stripping a bunch out of hsqldb, there are still some dependencies that 3.4.5 doesn't meet.  but maybe we can hack those out too... if necessary)</p>
<p>16:47 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if there's nothing else, lets move on over to 3) ???</p>
<p>16:47 &lt; jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:48 &lt; cervantes&gt; just to say "nice one bar" for his cool donation </p>
<p>16:48 &lt;+Complication&gt; Well, there was a question in the forum about uptimes presented in NetDB...</p>
<p>16:48  * Complication seconds that</p>
<p>16:49 &lt;+Complication&gt; 'bout the uptimes, if you recall, I fuzzified them slightly in March...</p>
<p>16:49 &lt; cervantes&gt; must have missed that amongst the odci.gov rants</p>
<p>16:50 &lt; tmp&gt; What on earth are you doing on that side roderick_spod?</p>
<p>16:50 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye Complication </p>
<p>16:50 &lt;+Complication&gt; Well, since the question was raised, I wondered if they could be fuzzified further, or would it hurt ability to debug?</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; jrandom&gt; i'm not sure of the point - with careful analysis, all of the stat data can reveal a bunch of information</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; arse&gt; do you guys think the network periodicity is gonna subside</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; jrandom&gt; when its time, we will just turn off the stat publhshing whatsoever</p>
<p>16:52 &lt;+Complication&gt; We haven't recently had any router-restarting ones, but that's only recently...</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; jrandom&gt; arse: yes</p>
<p>16:52 &lt;+Complication&gt; (and partly because the watchdog lacks teeth)</p>
<p>16:54 &lt;+Complication&gt; True, it's pretty inevitable that during this phase, some info must be out there</p>
<p>16:55 &lt; jrandom&gt; also, the assumption they've made isn't correct, publishedTimeAgo is how long ago the router /received/ the netDb entry, not when it was signed</p>
<p>16:55 &lt; jrandom&gt; erm, wait, no, thats not true</p>
<p>16:56 &lt; jrandom&gt; never mind me.  yeah, it just adds a small variation</p>
<p>16:56 &lt;+Complication&gt; Heh, I'm trying to post a reply, but get "no post mode specified" currently</p>
<p>16:57 &lt;+Complication&gt; Yeah, there's delay involved, and besides, how often was this info published? Not very frequently, IIRC?</p>
<p>16:57 &lt;+Complication&gt; Basically, if I offered to somewhat decrease the precision there, would you mind?</p>
<p>16:58 &lt; jrandom&gt; a new signed entry is published eery 5-15 minutes, but that is only published to the netDb, not all peers</p>
<p>16:58 &lt; jrandom&gt; peers only get the updated one when they either search for it or they reconnect</p>
<p>16:59 &lt; jrandom&gt; but yeah, adding more variation is fine.  it'd affect stat.i2p's uptime plots, but as long as it keeps things reasonable, thats cool</p>
<p>17:01 &lt;+Complication&gt; I'll try to keep it reasonable, then :)</p>
<p>17:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; heh cool, thanks Complication </p>
<p>17:04 &lt; jrandom&gt; *cough* (and consistent ;) ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
<p>17:04 &lt;+Complication&gt; sidenote: neat, the "post mode" bug yielded to persistence, and I could post a reply too :)</p>
<p>17:05 &lt; jrandom&gt; w3rd Complication </p>
<p><i>offtopic messages snipped</i></p>
<p>17:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if there's nothing else...</p>
<p>17:08  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>17:09  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
