<p>23:36 &lt; Disposable&gt; cool
<p>23:36 &lt; Disposable&gt; the famous capncrunch
<p>23:36 &lt; Disposable&gt; :P
<p>23:36 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; friend of mine
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>23:37 &lt; Disposable&gt; yeah?
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; he's working on porting iip to mac os 9
<p>23:37 &lt; Disposable&gt;  cool
<p>23:37 &lt; ptsc&gt; unfortunately i'm off to do laundry but will lurk
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>23:37 &lt; ptsc&gt; nop, why not an os x.2 clean version?
<p>23:37  * Disposable is listening to The Beets - Killer Tofu
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; what?
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; ptsc, we have os x versions
<p>23:37 &lt; Disposable&gt; hmmm
<p>23:37 &lt; nop&gt; we need os 9
<p>23:38 &lt; nop&gt; because there are still a lot of people on it
<p>23:38 &lt; ptsc&gt; ah, okay.  i was considering getting a mac that could run os x
<p>23:38 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>23:38 &lt; nop&gt; but only 20% of mac users have switched to X
<p>23:38 &lt; ptsc&gt; in my case, i'd be switching to mac specifically *because* of x
<p>23:39 &lt; Disposable&gt; lol
<p>23:39 &lt; Disposable&gt; yeah
<p>23:39 &lt; Disposable&gt; it looks so sweet
<p>23:39 &lt; Disposable&gt; :)
<p>23:39 &lt; Disposable&gt; i wunna try it
<p>23:39 &lt; Rain&gt; "unix for users done right" some feel
<p>23:39 &lt; ptsc&gt; i saw it at a friend's house who has been a mac freak for ages
<p>23:39 &lt; ptsc&gt; and it just looks awesome
<p>23:39 &lt; ptsc&gt; plus they brought back the NeXT-style file browser
<p>23:39 &lt; ptsc&gt; which has always ruled
<p>23:40 &lt; ptsc&gt; ok bbl
<p>23:40 &lt; Rain&gt; "the first lickable interface", according to mr jobs.
<p>23:41 &lt; Disposable&gt; :/

<p>00:00 &lt; nemesis&gt; blubb
<p>00:00 &lt; nemesis&gt; 23 UTC
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; welcome to the 21st iip meeting
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; on the agenda
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; 1) welcome
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; 2) why rc3 isn't released yet
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; 3) when will it be released
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; 4) OS 9 port by Cap'n Crunch
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; 5) Questions and comments
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; welcome
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; :)
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; codeshark is out of the country on business, and will be back later this week
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; he's our release coordinator
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; and if he's not back shortly, mids and I will arrange the release candidate
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; and do it that way by friday
<p>00:02 &lt; Aprogas&gt; one should only accept the function of release coordinator, if one knows to have time for that function
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; when will it be released, friday at latest
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; comments are saved for last 
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; thnx though aprogas
<p>00:03 &lt; Aprogas&gt; ok
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; ok, os 9 port, Cap'n Crunch has been working (along with his friend) on porting IIP to mac os 9 users
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; hopefully, he will be on here shortly to give us some detail
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; if not I'll send out an email
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; to iip-dev with the latest from him
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; oh speak of the devil
<p>00:04 &lt; crunchman&gt; Ok,   I'm on 
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; Hi crunch
<p>00:04 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: that must be bpb in disguise
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; can you give us a quick detail of what's going on with os 9
<p>00:04 &lt; crunchman&gt; Of course I didn't get the chance to read over the source so I can bring up my issues.
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; k
<p>00:05 &lt; crunchman&gt; yes - I can.
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; the floor is yours, take it away
<p>00:05 &lt; crunchman&gt; basically - the way IIP was written,  it's a CAAN OF WORMS if I have to use the structures you are already using.
<p>00:06 &lt; crunchman&gt; There is NO discrete seperation between the GUI and the guts.
<p>00:06 &lt; crunchman&gt; Let me explain.
<p>00:06 &lt; crunchman&gt; It is VERY baised towards WinBlows.
<p>00:06 &lt; crunchman&gt; As you know,  the Mac uses resources for the GUI components.
<p>00:07 &lt; crunchman&gt; I need to examine the code now,   and would like to take a few mins to go over my notes,  so I can be more specific.
<p>00:07 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:07 &lt; nop&gt; either way, we can cover that later, but Crunch is working on the os 9, and we will aid him with what we can so that it may be not so tedious a task
<p>00:08 &lt; nop&gt; reasons for the port, is only 20% of mac users have made the switch to os x
<p>00:08 &lt; nop&gt; they still rely on os 9
<p>00:08 &lt; nop&gt; so a lot of mac os users donated money towards this goal
<p>00:08 &lt; nop&gt; and any other donations are welcome to assist crunch for his time on this project
<p>00:09 &lt; nop&gt; questions and comments from iip users etc
<p>00:09 &lt; nop&gt; ?
<p>00:09  * Disposable is listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival - Fortunate Son
<p>00:09 &lt; Aprogas&gt; comment: one should only accept the function of release coordinator, if one knows to have time for that function
<p>00:09 &lt; Rain&gt; question: what will be new in rc3
<p>00:09 &lt; Rain&gt; ?
<p>00:09 &lt; nop&gt; mainly bug fixes, hold, I'll get the changelog
<p>00:09 &lt; Aprogas&gt; /exec -o cat ChangeLog | head -200
<p>00:10 &lt; bpb&gt; question: since when does IIP get donations?
<p>00:10 &lt; crunchman&gt; bob cant get on
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + iip1.1-rc3:
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + - Display of version number for windows (menu option) and unix (command line).
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + - Random number generation fix.
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + - IIP network connections are no longer paused while in the setup screen.
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + - Now exits if it can't bind to a socket at startup.
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; +   Windows now displays a message box informing that it can't bind to port.
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + - Several bugfixes and one memory leak fixed.
<p>00:10 &lt; crunchman&gt; i
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; + 
<p>00:10 &lt; crunchman&gt; im on phone - helping him
<p>00:10 &lt; crunchman&gt; hold on
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; k
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; that is the changelog
<p>00:11 &lt; Aprogas&gt; comment: women are always late
<p>00:11 &lt; crunchman&gt; hold on - still on phone w/ bob
<p>00:11 &lt; Rain&gt; ok, thanks.
<p>00:11 &lt; nop&gt; haha
<p>00:11 &lt; nop&gt; ok meeting is officially over
<p>00:11 &lt; bpb&gt; if he can't get iip to work, he could connect to my node
<p>00:11 &lt; Aprogas&gt; huh ?
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; I will resume talks with crunch in here
<p>00:12 &lt; athena&gt; okay, so i can slap aprogas now?
<p>00:12 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but maybe i still had questions or commens
<p>00:12 &lt; bpb&gt; :)
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; aprogas
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; do you have any more questions
<p>00:12 &lt; Aprogas&gt; am i being ignored?
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; or comments
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; that pertains to IIP
<p>00:12 &lt; Rain&gt; is the "sneak release" the same as the final one, and will i dare running it on a public proxy at this stage?
<p>00:12 &lt; crunchman&gt; meeting is over?  - but we havent even gotten on yet!
<p>00:12 &lt; Aprogas&gt; where is mids?
<p>00:12 &lt; bpb&gt; crunchman: that's nop for you...
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; crunch we can still talk in here
<p>00:12 &lt; Aprogas&gt; no mids no meeting
<p>00:12 &lt; crunchman&gt; Bob is trying to get on - and yet the meeting is now over?
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; rain sneak is the same yes
<p>00:12 &lt; nemesis&gt; hm... nop, i use blackbox under windows xp, why theres no cmd line version of IIP out?
<p>00:13 &lt; nemesis&gt; that i can use as an service..
<p>00:13 &lt; crunchman&gt; bpb - I have no clue what you mean by "crunchman: that's nop for you"
<p>00:13 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb means nothing with it
<p>00:13 &lt; Aprogas&gt; he loves to confuse people
<p>00:13 &lt; nop&gt; well, nemesis iip -d might be able to do that for you
<p>00:13 &lt; crunchman&gt; still trying to get bob logged in.
<p>00:13 &lt; bpb&gt; crunchman: he's cutting off the meeting after it hasn't begun
<p>00:14 &lt; nop&gt; the "official" meeting is over
<p>00:14 &lt; Disposable&gt; hehe
<p>00:14 &lt; nop&gt; other than comments
<p>00:14 &lt; crunchman&gt; sorry I couldn't get on sooner.
<p>00:14 &lt; Rain&gt; ok, so i might as well de-install the rc2 proxy i recently installed today, and replace it with rc3, no risk?
<p>00:14 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: will there be an rc4 or even rc5, and when are they expected, and when is iip 1.1 expected?
<p>00:14 &lt; nop&gt; rc3 should be final before 1.1
<p>00:15 &lt; nop&gt; unless
<p>00:15 &lt; Aprogas&gt; of course the release candidate comes before the release
<p>00:15 &lt; crunchman&gt; Could someone call bob on phone and help him
<p>00:15 &lt; nop&gt; unless major bugs were found
<p>00:15 &lt; nemesis&gt; hm....
<p>00:15 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: why do i get the idea you forget what a rc is all the time ?
<p>00:15 &lt; nemesis&gt; nop, must i shutdown my current iip for -d?
<p>00:16 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: so when are 1.1 and 1.1-rc3 expected?
<p>00:16  * bpb remembers when decentralized 2.0 was expected ;)
<p>00:16 &lt; nemesis&gt; crunchman: help with what?
<p>00:17 &lt; crunchman&gt; bob cant get on this IRC server.
<p>00:17 &lt; crunchman&gt; I tried to help him - I gave up.
<p>00:17  * Aprogas remembers saying that iip 1.1 would be released the day after freenet 0.5
<p>00:17 &lt; crunchman&gt; I asked Lance to help him get on.
<p>00:17 &lt; Aprogas&gt; crunchman: what kind of error does he get ?
<p>00:17 &lt; crunchman&gt; When he's on...  he can give you guys an update in HIS progress.
<p>00:18  * Disposable is listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival - Susie Q
<p>00:18 &lt; crunchman&gt; I don't know - I didnt get chance to ask him - sorry.
<p>00:18 &lt; nemesis&gt; waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah *crying*
<p>00:18 &lt; nemesis&gt; mids
<p>00:18 &lt; nemesis&gt; i have 5 iip process running...
<p>00:18 &lt; crunchman&gt; I REALLY would like to go off and re-examine the IIP work I did - so I can answer intellegent questions on the issues I want to bring up.
<p>00:18 &lt; nemesis&gt; fuck it *grrr*
<p>00:18 &lt; crunchman&gt; but I want BOB up here first.
<p>00:19 &lt; crunchman&gt; because he also has to explain HIS part in the project
<p>00:19 &lt; Aprogas&gt; it would be useful if we would know what kind of problem he has with connecting to here
<p>00:19 &lt; crunchman&gt; I think he will address the group on his "socket" problems.
<p>00:19 &lt; Aprogas&gt; is he using his own isproxy or yours?
<p>00:19 &lt; crunchman&gt; Nop is talking to him on the phone right now - i hope.;
<p>00:20 &lt; crunchman&gt; Bob has a Mac...   I think he's using ircle
<p>00:20 &lt; crunchman&gt; this is what I'm using right now.
<p>00:20 &lt; nop&gt; I am
<p>00:20 &lt; nop&gt; athena
<p>00:20  * Kyfhon remembers trying that vile thing in an emulator
<p>00:20 &lt; Disposable&gt; question: primary mac developeman will before os 9 ? 
<p>00:20 &lt; nop&gt; he's using athena
<p>00:20 &lt; crunchman&gt; ok,  i'll be right back.
<p>00:20 &lt; nemesis&gt; re....
<p>00:20 &lt; nemesis&gt; are no pid implented in iip yet?
<p>00:21 &lt; nemesis&gt; or cmd line output...
<p>00:21 &lt; nop&gt; crunch, his inet connection is acting up
<p>00:21 &lt; nemesis&gt; i always started a new instance with iip -d  or -h or -? and ?
<p>00:23 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe he could come tomorrow, or at next week's meeting then
<p>00:24 &lt; bpb&gt; well, captn crunch made a atleast celebrity appearance today.
<p>00:24 &lt; bpb&gt; err
<p>00:24 &lt; Aprogas&gt; never heard of him, im from the pentium generation
<p>00:25 &lt; bpb&gt; minus the atleast
<p>00:25 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: you never heard of captain crunch?
<p>00:25 &lt; Aprogas&gt; no
<p>00:25 &lt; bpb&gt; he is THE LEGEND
<p>00:25 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: IIP should become a tiny bit more formal
<p>00:25 &lt; xenode&gt; im from the pentium generation and i still've heard of him
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; formal?
<p>00:25 &lt; Aprogas&gt; of course its an opensores project, so it will always be informal
<p>00:25 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: you mean without your rudeness?
<p>00:26 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but right now it seems like a chaotic bunch of people doing some things in a basement and something coming out of nowhere once in a while
<p>00:26 &lt; bpb&gt; Captain Crunch is the man who started telephone fraud :)
<p>00:26 &lt; Aprogas&gt; it seems completely unorganised to me
<p>00:26 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb: as i said, im from the pentium generator
<p>00:26 &lt; xenode&gt; Aprogas: thats no excuse
<p>00:26 &lt; bpb&gt; well, maybe not started it, but he did it using a captain crunch whistle
<p>00:26 &lt; nemesis&gt; hm....
<p>00:27 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its not meant as an excuse, its a reason
<p>00:27 &lt; rda&gt; i am here
<p>00:27 &lt; xenode&gt; its not a reason either
<p>00:27 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Aprogas: What do you expect? Snappy logos and a pr gremlin?
<p>00:27 &lt; nemesis&gt; irc are at the most time idle
<p>00:27 &lt; Aprogas&gt; kyfhon: no, but that is all i see now
<p>00:27 &lt; bpb&gt; ...and used it to call the pope long distance for free
<p>00:27 &lt; nemesis&gt; whats about VoIP (IIP) ;)
<p>00:27 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i'd like releases, and code, and bugfixes and stuff
<p>00:27 &lt; nemesis&gt; 8kbit datastream
<p>00:27 &lt; bpb&gt; the legendary phone call
<p>00:27 &lt; Aprogas&gt; and less t-shirts, mugs, and interviews
<p>00:27  * Kyfhon didn't know there were tshirts. Hmm
<p>00:27 &lt; crunchman&gt; Ok,  back on again.
<p>00:28 &lt; crunchman&gt; ok
<p>00:28 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: I can't believe you hadn't heard of Captn Crunch
<p>00:28 &lt; nemesis&gt; lol
<p>00:28 &lt; hezekiah&gt; crunchman: Good! :)
<p>00:28 &lt; bpb&gt; geez Aprogas, you're a disgrace
<p>00:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb: i know
<p>00:29 &lt; bpb&gt; next thing I know you'll be saying you don't know who Steve Wozniac is
<p>00:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: i also feel like my suggestions are being ignored
<p>00:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; dont know him either
<p>00:29 &lt; nop&gt; well, you expect quite a bit
<p>00:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im a hermit, i dont know many people
<p>00:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe
<p>00:29 &lt; xenode&gt; he must be fooling with us.. i mean.. jeez
<p>00:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; or maybe IIP isnt what i thought it was
<p>00:29 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: what about Steve Jobs?
<p>00:29 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: Bill Gates?
<p>00:30 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb: sounds familiar, isnt he the Apple CEO
<p>00:30 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: 0x90
<p>00:30 &lt; bpb&gt; yep
<p>00:30 &lt; Aprogas&gt; and the second one the Microsoft Fuehrer
<p>00:30 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i know 0x90
<p>00:30 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but he isnt legendary
<p>00:30 &lt; bpb&gt; true
<p>00:30 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: what is IIP actually?
<p>00:30 &lt; bpb&gt; but I wanted to make sure you knew who he was :)
<p>00:31 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i know his address, get a copy of his phone bill, listen to his phonecalls sometimes, and have camera's behind his mirrors
<p>00:31 &lt; Aprogas&gt; so i know him
<p>00:31 &lt; bpb&gt; but captain crunch is one of the few true legends we have in the world of geekdom
<p>00:31 &lt; xenode&gt; heh
<p>00:31 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im not a geek, im a hermit
<p>00:31 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: that's too bad
<p>00:31 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but i need IRC for some dynamics
<p>00:31 &lt; Aprogas&gt; my shack is only statis
<p>00:32 &lt; Aprogas&gt; and statis does not bring much inspiration
<p>00:32 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: you know the world of geekdom well, correct? :)
<p>00:32 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:32 &lt; nop&gt; aprogas IIP is what it is
<p>00:32 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: which is ?
<p>00:32 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im not sure if i know what IIP is actually
<p>00:32 &lt; Aprogas&gt; or what it is meant to be
<p>00:32 &lt; Aprogas&gt; can you tell me ?
<p>00:33 &lt; nop&gt; it would take too long
<p>00:33 &lt; nop&gt; read the site
<p>00:33 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bla
<p>00:33 &lt; nop&gt; rda join #dev
<p>00:33 &lt; bpb&gt; haha
<p>00:33 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i read it
<p>00:33 &lt; Aprogas&gt; #dev, #iip-dev, #iip, #anonymous
<p>00:33 &lt; Aprogas&gt; *g*
<p>00:33 &lt; Aprogas&gt; you want to DoS my client by letting me join more channels than it can handle?
<p>00:33 &lt; bpb&gt; they're all conspiring against us in #dev
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; well aprogas it doesn't matter to you
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; you're not a developer
<p>00:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; ok
<p>00:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; indeed i am not
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; so your expectations must remain as a critic
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; critics don't get what they want
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; developers do
<p>00:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im not a critic
<p>00:34 &lt; bpb&gt; hahaha
<p>00:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im a disappointed enthusiast
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:35 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: you never answered my question from the meeting btw...
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; and I appreciate your dissapointment
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; which one bpb
<p>00:35 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: since when does IIP get donations?
<p>00:35 &lt; Aprogas&gt; someone who thought it would be possible to resist opression without needing dark basements and information exchanges in the park
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; well they have bpb
<p>00:36 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: since when, how much, etc.? :)
<p>00:36 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: the critics must know ;)
<p>00:36 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: i think you still did not tell me when iip 1.1 will be done
<p>00:37 &lt; nop&gt; I can't give that answer until rc3 is released
<p>00:37 &lt; Aprogas&gt; can you give a rough estimate ?
<p>00:37 &lt; Aprogas&gt; or at least tell me when you expect rc3
<p>00:38 &lt; nop&gt; rc3 by friday
<p>00:38 &lt; nop&gt; at worse case
<p>00:38 &lt; Aprogas&gt; so by friday you can give a rough estimate about when iip 1.1 will be done ?
<p>00:38 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:38 &lt; Aprogas&gt; ok, ill stay until friday then
<p>00:39 &lt; nop&gt; fine with me
<p>00:39 &lt; nop&gt; what do you expect from IIP aprogas
<p>00:39 &lt; nop&gt; and why
<p>00:39 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i dont know what to expect from IIP
<p>00:39 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but i can try to analyse what i expect from it
<p>00:40 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i think i expect IIP to be a certain `medium' which i can use to say anything i would like without having feelings of fear along with saying those things
<p>00:40 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but i think i also expect IIP to have a somewhat professional, or at least organised, character
<p>00:41 &lt; Aprogas&gt; probably because i would have more trust in the application if that would be the case
<p>00:41 &lt; nop&gt; I can't demand professionals unless I can pay them
<p>00:41 &lt; Aprogas&gt; you can act like a professional
<p>00:41 &lt; nop&gt; since people like you choose not to donate substantial amounts of money, and only your criticism it will be hard
<p>00:41 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i dont enjoy criticism
<p>00:42 &lt; Aprogas&gt; and i would love the develop if i didnt think the development team was an unorganised bunch of people
<p>00:42 &lt; nop&gt; it's not unorganized
<p>00:42 &lt; nop&gt; it's quite organized
<p>00:42 &lt; Aprogas&gt; it seems to be
<p>00:42 &lt; nop&gt; it's just not the way you want it
<p>00:42  * Debolaz whispers to the developers next to him: "Don't take it personally.. someday, you'll be a real live boy"
<p>00:42 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe
<p>00:43 &lt; nop&gt; aprogas, if you want to be the leader
<p>00:43 &lt; nop&gt; than that is up to you
<p>00:43 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i dont want to be the leader at all
<p>00:43 &lt; nemesis&gt; hrhr
<p>00:43 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i want to be unknown, because being unknown is safer
<p>00:43 &lt; nop&gt; correct
<p>00:43 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Dear gods. Aprogas get your head out of your ass. These people are doing this on their own time and letting everyone use it, and you're demanding behavior modification
<p>00:44 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i am just giving these people some advice
<p>00:44 &lt; nemesis&gt; achja, fehlt nur noch ardvark ;)
<p>00:44 &lt; Aprogas&gt; if you make a tool, but if you seem like an unorganised bunch, that will probably repell serious users
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; well, we have serious software that works
<p>00:44 &lt; Aprogas&gt; sure, you'll attract some geeks who can say `look mommy, im now anonymous'
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; and a serious website
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; and we have decent organization
<p>00:44 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Well your advice was given quite awhile ago. You keep giving the advice repeatedly and thus it looks like demands from my end
<p>00:44 &lt; Aprogas&gt; then why do you hide that ?
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; I think that we have gone farther than a lot of open source projects
<p>00:44 &lt; Aprogas&gt; if you have serious softwar that works, why dont you release it ?
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; you're using it right now
<p>00:45 &lt; Aprogas&gt; it doesnt seem to work well
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; and if you want rc3
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; it's in cvs
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; ready for you
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; and when rc3 is ready for the General audience
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; it will be released
<p>00:45 &lt; Aprogas&gt; my isproxy often complains it cannot reach certain things, and sometimes just vanishes without a trace
<p>00:45 &lt; nemesis&gt; hm.... irgendwie hat er ja recht...
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; probably because someone hated your noc
<p>00:45 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: well, what's the goal of IIP anyway?  And how close is it to reaching that goal?
<p>00:45 &lt; Aprogas&gt; no
<p>00:45 &lt; nemesis&gt; lol
<p>00:45 &lt; Aprogas&gt; it did that before that
<p>00:46 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb: the goal of IIP is to be what it is
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; bpb, the goal is obvious
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; if you haven't read the site
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; then I can't help you
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; I'm not going to be long winded
<p>00:46 &lt; nemesis&gt; hm...
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; I am programmed to have a array of 200 characters max per line
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; and I prefer it to be shorter
<p>00:46 &lt; nop&gt; obviously
<p>00:46 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: I've read the sites ever since casper the friendly ghost...
<p>00:46 &lt; nemesis&gt; 200?
<p>00:47 &lt; nop&gt; then you're asking a rhetorical question
<p>00:47 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: is the central IIP server reliable ?
<p>00:47 &lt; nop&gt; it hasn't gone down for a very long time
<p>00:47 &lt; nop&gt; it's hosted in a secured facility
<p>00:47 &lt; nemesis&gt; 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
<p>00:47 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: no, I don't believe I am...  maybe I should rephrase...
<p>00:47 &lt; nemesis&gt; thats 200 ^^
<p>00:47 &lt; Aprogas&gt; even before our NOC was destroyed, i got disconnected from IIP at least once a day i think
<p>00:47 &lt; Aprogas&gt; so i wouldnt really call that `software that works'
<p>00:47 &lt; nop&gt; well, you're talking on it now
<p>00:47 &lt; nop&gt; so
<p>00:48 &lt; Aprogas&gt; sure
<p>00:48 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but i want it to be reliable
<p>00:48 &lt; Aprogas&gt; you never know when you are going to need it
<p>00:48 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: why did you start IIP exactly?
<p>00:48 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb: to mock his wife
<p>00:48 &lt; nop&gt; because it was cool
<p>00:48 &lt; nop&gt; and i wanted to be cool
<p>00:48 &lt; nop&gt; don't you know
<p>00:48 &lt; nop&gt; I'm in california
<p>00:48 &lt; nop&gt; it's all about cool
<p>00:48 &lt; nemesis&gt; ;)
<p>00:49 &lt; nemesis&gt; and whate are you think about your project at this time? ;)
<p>00:49 &lt; bpb&gt; ...
<p>00:49 &lt; bpb&gt; heh
<p>00:49 &lt; nop&gt; next I'll get breast implants
<p>00:49 &lt; nop&gt; I think it's cool
<p>00:49 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:49 &lt; nemesis&gt; hehe ;)
<p>00:49 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: hey, if you're a city employee in SF, free sex change ;)
<p>00:49 &lt; nop&gt; look aprogas, you've made your comments
<p>00:49 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe
<p>00:50 &lt; nop&gt; and they are heard
<p>00:50 &lt; nop&gt; and we do our best
<p>00:50 &lt; bpb&gt; nop: butt sex is also cool in california ;)
<p>00:50 &lt; Aprogas&gt; they havent been really said
<p>00:50 &lt; nemesis&gt; why you wan't to limit the max characters to max 200 each per line?
<p>00:50 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its hard to express what exactly i mean
<p>00:50 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its just that everytime i try to do something with anonimity and stuff, it fails
<p>00:50 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its a big disappointment
<p>00:51 &lt; nemesis&gt; thats true..
<p>00:51 &lt; Aprogas&gt; every few months i cvs checkout freenet again, see if it works already
<p>00:51 &lt; Aprogas&gt; then it seems to work, and at the moment i am to share my excitement with others, it breaks into a horrible pit of frustration and agony
<p>00:51 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im afraid IIP is going to be affected by the same curse
<p>00:52 &lt; nop&gt; well aprogas, more comments say IIP works better than freenet
<p>00:52 &lt; nop&gt; but it's a work in progress
<p>00:52 &lt; bpb&gt; If you want to be cool, you just need to let everybody know you're friends with captn crunch... oh wait, you've done that too ;)
<p>00:52 &lt; Aprogas&gt; thats why i still use IIP right now and ditched freenet
<p>00:52 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Heh ever since freenet 0.5 it takes like 5 minutes to retr something.
<p>00:52 &lt; Aprogas&gt; kyfhon: thats not that bad
<p>00:52 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i can wait 5 minutes
<p>00:52 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; ...With a50% failure rate
<p>00:53 &lt; nemesis&gt; hrhr
<p>00:53 &lt; Aprogas&gt; mm.. maybe i should try freenet again
<p>00:53 &lt; bpb&gt; yeah
<p>00:53 &lt; bpb&gt; 0.4 during a certain era was great
<p>00:53 &lt; Aprogas&gt; is that with the 5xx or 6xx build?
<p>00:53 &lt; Aprogas&gt; most of the time 0.4 was broken
<p>00:53 &lt; Aprogas&gt; and trying to insert something in freenet 0.3 traumatised me
<p>00:53 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: 0.5 is 5xx and 6xx
<p>00:54 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; 0.5.0.6 tarball
<p>00:54 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bpb: thats why im asking where kyfhon gets those decent results
<p>00:54 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but i shouldnt be naive
<p>00:54 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i know its going to faiil
<p>00:54 &lt; Aprogas&gt; because i use kaffe
<p>00:54 &lt; Aprogas&gt; so ill try again later
<p>00:54 &lt; bpb&gt; haha
<p>00:55 &lt; bpb&gt; kaffe works fine with freenet
<p>00:55 &lt; bpb&gt; evil GPL ware
<p>00:55 &lt; Aprogas&gt; nop: i think the problem with the IIP developers team is that they are a bunch of geeks who are coding a program for a bunch of other geeks
<p>00:55 &lt; bpb&gt; anyway...  shouldn't we be talking in #anonymous
<p>00:55 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but it would be nice if IIP would also target different users
<p>00:56 &lt; bpb&gt; Aprogas: umm, what do you think the first computers were, and look at them now ;)
<p>00:56 &lt; Aprogas&gt; users who dont just want to explore the technology of being anonymous, but users who actually need being anonymous
<p>00:56 &lt; Aprogas&gt; the first computers were used in the textile industry i think
<p>00:59 &lt; Rain&gt; they were not really computers, though. more like automats. they could not actually process information, only act on a given program. progammed looms.
<p>01:00 &lt; Aprogas&gt; are there any users on here who arent here just for the kick of being `anonymous' ?
<p>01:00  * Debolaz isn't being anonymous here.
<p>01:00 &lt; Aprogas&gt; debolaz: why are you here ?
<p>01:00 &lt; nemesis&gt; me?
<p>01:01 &lt; Rain&gt; i like the people, and i want to see how it turns out.
<p>01:01 &lt; Aprogas&gt; bla
<p>01:02 &lt; Aprogas&gt; you would whine too if you were in my position
<p>01:02 &lt; Aprogas&gt; you fucking rats
<p>01:02 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Wah =[
<p>01:02 &lt; nemesis&gt; hrhr
<p>01:02 &lt; mateofree&gt; what was that?!?
<p>01:02 &lt; nemesis&gt; "&lt;Aprogas&gt; you would whine too if you were in my position"
<p>01:02 &lt; nemesis&gt; what he mean with this?
<p>01:03 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; He prolly needs anonymity. Or something.
<p>01:03 &lt; mateofree&gt; I might have an idea for logo
<p>01:03 &lt; mateofree&gt; mind if I throw it out here?
<p>01:04 &lt; Rain&gt; go ahead man..
<p>01:04 &lt; mateofree&gt; ok
<p>01:05 &lt; mateofree&gt; well I thought maybe a head either in profile or from front..
<p>01:05 &lt; mateofree&gt; with one side dissolving into ones and zeros
<p>01:06 &lt; Rain&gt; might look nice, but what is the "iip specific" thing of it?
<p>01:06 &lt; mateofree&gt; hehe don´t know
<p>01:06 &lt; mateofree&gt; hello fw
<p>01:06 &lt; mateofree&gt; the eye is closed btw
<p>01:07 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; the eye?
<p>01:07 &lt; mateofree&gt; so there is some allusion to "invisible" "not seen"
<p>01:07 &lt; mateofree&gt; hehe
<p>01:07 &lt; Rain&gt; hmm, that might work.
<p>01:07 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Submarine dissolving into (1|0)'s
<p>01:07 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; your talking about a logo?
<p>01:07 &lt; Rain&gt; pehaps a question mark somewhere..
<p>01:07 &lt; mateofree&gt; don´t go anywhere, I will upload it
<p>01:07 &lt; mateofree&gt; I have a scetch
<p>01:08 &lt; mateofree&gt; have to log first
<p>01:08 &lt; mateofree&gt; brb
<p>01:08 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; hey about dcc on iip irc, perhaps freenet could be used
<p>01:09 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; It would take years to send a file :&gt;
<p>01:09 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; hum not really !!
<p>01:09 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Well, not _that_ long
<p>01:09 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; a irc command could be used for trading the key
<p>01:09 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Might as well just give out refs
<p>01:10 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; simulating a dcc
<p>01:10 &lt; Rain&gt; does anyone know if there is any project 
<p>01:10 &lt; Rain&gt; to make a native freenet node implementation?
<p>01:10 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; That would be nice
<p>01:11 &lt; Rain&gt; the last one died, but now that 0.5 is actually released
<p>01:11 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Isn't there a java compiler that outputs native bins?
<p>01:11 &lt; Rain&gt; yeah, but i belive i read that there was some misc trouble with it
<p>01:11 &lt; Rain&gt; ie, the process is not perfect
<p>01:11 &lt; Kyfhon&gt; Hm
<p>01:15  * Kyfhon has to scram
<p>01:17 &lt; mateofree&gt; check here: http://briefcase.yahoo.com/mateo_freeman
<p>01:18 &lt; mateofree&gt; in IIP sketch folder
<p>01:20 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; What's this image proposed for Mateo?
<p>01:20 &lt; mateofree&gt; IIP logo
<p>01:20 &lt; mateofree&gt; just an idea I got
<p>01:20 &lt; mateofree&gt; just now
<p>01:21 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; can you explain the image?
<p>01:21 &lt; mateofree&gt; well, it is a head either in profile or from front, with closed eye
<p>01:21 &lt; mateofree&gt; and one side dissolves into ones and zeros
<p>01:22 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; ahhh.. I could see that it was disolving but not what into
<p>01:22 &lt; mateofree&gt; oh, well I did it fast so...
<p>01:22 &lt; mateofree&gt; just to get the idea out, hehe
<p>01:23 &lt; mateofree&gt; don´t know if it is proper though
<p>01:23 &lt; mateofree&gt; might be too ambigous
<p>01:24 &lt; mateofree&gt; might work though as a t shirt logo though
<p>01:24 &lt; mateofree&gt; a little one on chest or somethign
<p>01:24 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; might be a bit detailed for a tshiort
<p>01:24 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I think it is a great idea and woudl love to see you develop it. 
<p>01:24 &lt; mateofree&gt; well, I was thinking of simplyfying it
<p>01:25 &lt; mateofree&gt; with more clean lines
<p>01:25 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; Kool. 
<p>01:25 &lt; mateofree&gt; I kind of like the profle one
<p>01:25 &lt; mateofree&gt; profile
<p>01:25 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; that's much better for screen printing...
<p>01:26 &lt; mateofree&gt; yes
<p>01:26 &lt; mateofree&gt; maybe something with lines, as in that picture is better than ones and zeros
<p>01:26 &lt; mateofree&gt; might be too small to see
<p>01:26 &lt; mateofree&gt; ones and zeros that is
<p>01:27 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I lik ethe fading to 1's and 0's idea...
<p>01:28 &lt; mateofree&gt; yes.. but would maybe be to small for something like t shirt?
<p>01:28 &lt; mateofree&gt; the "point" is though the shut eye
<p>01:28 &lt; mateofree&gt; that is what ties to invisible
<p>01:30 &lt; Rain&gt; i actually like the sound of that. simple enought. together with the "iip" text, it will be pretty obvious, even to a non techie. they might not now what a "proxy" is, but "invisible" and "net" should be prettey obvious.
<p>01:31 &lt; Rain&gt; heh, a "closed eye" is kinda the opposite of the "lidless eye" from LOTR...
<p>01:31 &lt; mateofree&gt; hehe
<p>01:32 &lt; mateofree&gt; hmm, maybe an open eye over a pyramid might be better..... ;)
<p>01:33 &lt; Rain&gt; hmm, that seems kinda familiar....
<p>01:33 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; hu my job is graphism and 3d so if u need ...
<p>01:33 &lt; mateofree&gt; cool
<p>01:33 &lt; Rain&gt; (note to self: learn to spell)

<p>01:34 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; http://www.renderosity.com/gallery.ez?ByArtist=Y&Artist=delly

<p>01:35 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; yes ive tried it
<p>01:35 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; ive luv the cinema 4d rendering too
<p>01:36 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; actually for fast done animation I prefer moray 303
<p>01:36 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; and lightwave for not fast done :)
<p>01:36 &lt; mateofree&gt; oh btw did you see my post on dc?

<p>01:44 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; so much features
<p>01:45 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah
<p>01:45 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; have u try flamingo too ?
<p>01:45 &lt; mateofree&gt; truespace is amazing
<p>01:45 &lt; mateofree&gt; nope
<p>01:45 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; its great and too easy to use materials
<p>01:45 &lt; mateofree&gt; only have rhino 1. something and truespace 4. something 
<p>01:45 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; but slow
<p>01:45 &lt; mateofree&gt; haven´t used them in years
<p>01:45 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; truespace have nice render and seems fast
<p>01:46 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; Sorry to split in the middle of a conv Mateo but I had to get the phone..
<p>01:46 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; rhino 3 beta is available
<p>01:46 &lt; mateofree&gt; I like that truespace is a complete package
<p>01:46 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I agree with the previous commment that the face looks quite unhappy.
<p>01:46 &lt; mateofree&gt; hehe np fw
<p>01:46 &lt; mateofree&gt; ofcourse it is unhappy, having to hide away from the statists, hehe
<p>01:46 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; have u and url I could see the actuall iip logo
<p>01:46 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; Do either of you have PalmS?
<p>01:47 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; PDA's that is?
<p>01:47 &lt; mateofree&gt; nope
<p>01:47 &lt; mateofree&gt; gilles du you mean:  http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/
<p>01:47 &lt; mateofree&gt; or my example?
<p>01:48 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; bummer :) 
<p>01:48 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I have a palm addiction... I found an excellent drawing program for Plam OS
<p>01:48 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I LOVE your gallery Gilles2Rais!!
<p>01:48 &lt; mateofree&gt; cool
<p>01:48 &lt; mateofree&gt; the palms are really cool
<p>01:49 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I use it a lot as it is great t be able to have coloured drawing tools wherever I go 
<p>01:49 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; and it can print the images at ANY size with no loss of quality as it is vector based
<p>01:49 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah I bet
<p>01:50 &lt; mateofree&gt; I have a wacom drawing tablet, very cool
<p>01:50 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; I need it
<p>01:50 &lt; Gilles2Rais&gt; but my mouse is terrible :)
<p>01:50 &lt; mateofree&gt; I guess palm is kind of like it
<p>01:50 &lt; mateofree&gt; hehe
<p>01:50 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I nearly bought one of them...
<p>01:50 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah drawing witgh mouse is ipossible for me
<p>01:50 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; but I bought a film scanner instead
<p>01:51 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I don't do a lot of drawing.. mostly photos.
<p>01:51 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; and retouching is ok with a mouse... but a tblet woud be better
<p>01:51 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah
<p>01:51 &lt; mateofree&gt; it is pretty amazing really
<p>01:52 &lt; mateofree&gt; you think it might be weird but it is very intuitive
<p>01:52 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I will console myself with the fact that I LOVE my film scanner :0
<p>01:52 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; though now i have got a digital camera...
<p>01:53 &lt; mateofree&gt; hehe what model is it?
<p>01:53 &lt; mateofree&gt; oh yeah an ixus right?
<p>01:53 &lt; mateofree&gt; those are cool
<p>01:53 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I know this probably sounds silly but I didn;t get a tablet because i just have no more desk space
<p>01:53 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; yeah
<p>01:53 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; it is ok for stuff to go on the web
<p>01:53 &lt; mateofree&gt; lol
<p>01:53 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; but big prints are a bit suboptimal
<p>01:54 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah
<p>01:54 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; nothing like film for resolution..
<p>01:54 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; but I am OVER the chemicals.
<p>01:54 &lt; mateofree&gt; well.....
<p>01:54 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I will soon be putting up the kipbetbot page whic has some nice shots on it...
<p>01:54 &lt; mateofree&gt; price is a bit to high right now but there are very good alternatives
<p>01:55 &lt; mateofree&gt; for digital cams
<p>01:55 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; true, but I am waiting... I think there will be a big jump in quality soon.
<p>01:55 &lt; mateofree&gt; for about 2000 dollars you can get a digital cam as good as 35mm film
<p>01:55 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah
<p>01:55 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; and I want one of the decents lens makers to come up with an really goood digital camera...
<p>01:56 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; ...but lenses...?
<p>01:56 &lt; mateofree&gt; oh the proffesional ones are compatible with standard lenses
<p>01:56 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; resolution on the screen is nice... but oyu need the lenses ot get good images to utilise the high res
<p>01:56 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; still too expensive though..
<p>01:57 &lt; mateofree&gt; yeah
<p>01:57 &lt; mateofree&gt; but if trends are going as lately it will be cheap soon
<p>01:57 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; anyway I am supposed ot be working... gotta go...
<p>01:57 &lt; mateofree&gt; ok bye
<p>01:58 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; I hope so.. I'm counting on prices falling ...
<p>01:58 &lt; Fairwitness&gt; see you later
