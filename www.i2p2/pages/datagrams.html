{% block content %}<p>Datagrams build upon the base <a href="i2cp">I2CP</a> to provide authenticated
and repliable messages in a standard format.  This lets applications reliably read
the "from" address out of a datagram and know that the address really sent the
message.  This is necessary for some applications since the base I2P message is
completely raw - it has no "from" address (unlike IP packets).  In addition, the
message and sender is authenticated by signing the payload.</p>

<p>Applications written in Java that want to use datagrams can access the 
<a href="http://www.i2p.net/javadoc/net/i2p/client/datagram/package-summary.html">net.i2p.client.datagram</a>
package (a part of the core SDK in i2p.jar), while applications in other languages 
can use <a href="sam">SAM</a>'s datagram support.</p>{% endblock %}
