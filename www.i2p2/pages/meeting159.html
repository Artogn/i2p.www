<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 1) 0.6.1.7 and net status</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 2) Experimental tunnel failures</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 3) SSU and NATs</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 4) Syndie</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 5) ???</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:26  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-December/001237.html</p>
<p>15:26  * ailouros read the notes</p>
<p>15:27  * jrandom is late, so I'll give y'all a moment to read up :)</p>
<p>15:29 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, might as well jump on in to 1) 0.6.1.7 and net status</p>
<p>15:29 &lt;@cervantes&gt; *cough*</p>
<p>15:29 &lt; jrandom&gt; I don't have much more to add beyond whats in the mail on this point.  anyone have any further comments/questions/ideas?</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; Pseudonym&gt; seems like doing performance optimization before changing the the tunnel creation algo might be backwards</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; gott&gt; I am getting a lot of "No HTTP method found in the request.</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; gott&gt; Software caused connection abort: socket write error</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; gott&gt; "</p>
<p>15:30 &lt;@modulus&gt; tunnel lag is much lower, i don't know if you made any changes or my ISP is better all of a suden.</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; gott&gt; from the I2PTunnel Webmanager</p>
<p>15:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; gott: those suggest bad http requests, or things that the eepproxy ouldn't understand</p>
<p>15:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; modulus: cool, we've been doing lots to try and improve things</p>
<p>15:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; Pseudonym: well, so far tunnel creation hasn't been our choke point - our choke point was much higher level stuff</p>
<p>15:32 &lt; jrandom&gt; otoh, the improvements of the last few revs have exposed some issues down there</p>
<p>15:32 &lt; Pseudonym&gt; oh, so the optimization has been related to other parts of the code?</p>
<p>15:32 &lt; Pseudonym&gt; cool</p>
<p>15:33 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, at the SSU level, as well as the tunnel operation level.  tunnel creation is not a performance sensitive operation [except when it is ;]</p>
<p>15:34 &lt; jrandom&gt; I'm doing some live net load testing though, gathering some non-anonymous load stats of different peers to try to narrow things down further</p>
<p>15:34 &lt; ailouros&gt; I wonder why sometimes I see more tunnels than those configured for a destination (eg. eeProxy, inbound 7 tunnels 4 outbound)</p>
<p>15:34 &lt; jrandom&gt; so, over the next few days when you see the router 7xgV transferring lots of data, well, dont mind it ;)</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; jrandom&gt; ailouros: when tunnel creation takes a while, it builds extras, just in case.  </p>
<p>15:35 &lt; jrandom&gt; zzz outlines a few of the odd issues on that front too, and there's a patch being worked on to improve things a bit</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; ailouros&gt; I see.. but then why they all expire at the same time?</p>
<p>15:35 &lt;@cervantes&gt; jrandom: out of curiosity, when did you begin those tests?</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; jrandom&gt; cervantes: a few days ago</p>
<p>15:36 &lt;@cervantes&gt; ah cool, it's _not_ that then ;-)</p>
<p>15:36 &lt; jrandom&gt; dunno ailouros, depends on a few conditions.  but there are some... *cough* oddities in the tunnel creation code, which I've been holding off messing with since its getting rewritten for 0.6.2</p>
<p>15:38 &lt; ailouros&gt; I see. I thought it was a policy matter... I'd rather see the tunnels die at different times unless there's a good reason not to</p>
<p>15:38 &lt; ailouros&gt; as in, tunnel creations are skewed</p>
<p>15:39 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, there will be better randomization for 0.6.2, and zzz's patch adds some randomization for the current rev too</p>
<p>15:40 &lt;+Complication&gt; I wonder why an otherwise sane instance of i2phex... would decide to rehash files every other time I start it?</p>
<p>15:40 &lt; jrandom&gt; not a clue</p>
<p>15:40 &lt;+Complication&gt; Damaged configuration sounds the likely cause so far, but I've not deleted my config yet.</p>
<p>15:40 &lt; jrandom&gt; perhaps skewed timestamps?</p>
<p>15:42 &lt;+Complication&gt; Nah, they seem correct too</p>
<p>15:42  * jrandom knows not.  never looked at that part of phex's cod</p>
<p>15:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; er, code</p>
<p>15:42 &lt;+Complication&gt; I'll see if deleting old config files does it any good</p>
<p>15:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool</p>
<p>15:43 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anything else on 1) Net status / 0.6.1.7?</p>
<p>15:43 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, moving on to 2) Experimental tunnel failures</p>
<p>15:44 &lt; jrandom&gt; we've touched on this a bit already, and there's more in the notes and on zzz.i2p</p>
<p>15:44 &lt; jrandom&gt; zzz: do you have anything you want to add/bring up?</p>
<p>15:46 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets move on to 3) SSU and NATs</p>
<p>15:46 &lt; jrandom&gt; bar: anything you want to add?</p>
<p>15:46 &lt;+bar&gt; nope, i have nothing else to add but what's in the mail</p>
<p>15:47 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool, yeah I've still got to reply to some of the details - i think our retransmission will already take care of some of the issues you bring up</p>
<p>15:48 &lt; jrandom&gt; the trick is going to be detecting which situation is in play, so we can automate the right procedure (or inform the user that they're screwed)</p>
<p>15:48 &lt;+bar&gt; all in due time, no hurry</p>
<p>15:49 &lt;+bar&gt; aye, i suggested a manual user setting to circumvent that problem for the time being, perhaps it's not possible, but we can discuss it later</p>
<p>15:50 &lt; jrandom&gt; yeah, manual overrides will help, but my experience with earlier i2p revs was that everyone (*everyone*) fucked it up ;)  so automation is preferred </p>
<p>15:50 &lt; jrandom&gt; (everyone meaning myself included ;)</p>
<p>15:52 &lt;+bar&gt; agree</p>
<p>15:52 &lt; ailouros&gt; lol if I did too then there were something wrong with the docs, as I followed them bit by bit :D</p>
<p>15:53 &lt;+bar&gt; meanwhile, i will spend some time studying the peer testing</p>
<p>15:53 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool, thanks bar!</p>
<p>15:54 &lt;+bar&gt; (perhaps i could generate some useless spam regarding that as well :)</p>
<p>15:54 &lt; jrandom&gt; :)</p>
<p>15:55 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if there's nothing else on 3), lets move on to 4) Syndie</p>
<p>15:56 &lt; jrandom&gt; there has been a lot of progress on this front lately, with pretty substantial UI revamps since 0.6.1.7 came out</p>
<p>15:57 &lt; jrandom&gt; there's also a new standalone install/build, though since all of us have i2p installed, we don't need a separate one </p>
<p>15:57 &lt; ailouros&gt; I find that 6.1.7's layout is harder to use than 6.1.6's</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm, are you running syndie in single user mode?  and/or are you using the latest CVS build or the official 0.6.1.7 build?</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; ailouros&gt; official 0.6.1.7, single user</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; jrandom&gt; are you one of the proponents of the blog-like interface, as opposed to the threaded nav?</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; ailouros&gt; I am not, though I don't really know which is the blog-like</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; ailouros&gt; personally I'd rather have a threaded nav</p>
<p>15:59 &lt; ailouros&gt; (and some color-coding of new messages as well in thread view)</p>
<p>15:59 &lt;+Complication&gt; Relatively late CVS, single user</p>
<p>15:59 &lt;+Complication&gt; I've found a minor oddity (which I think, could be non-intended)</p>
<p>15:59 &lt; jrandom&gt; ah, there has been a lot of progress on that front in CVS ailouros </p>
<p>15:59 &lt; ailouros&gt; great :)</p>
<p>16:00 &lt; jrandom&gt; we've got a new threaded display too, using cervantes' suggested full traversal of just one branch, as opposed to all branches</p>
<p>16:00 &lt;@cervantes&gt; are those changes pushed to syndiemedia.i2p.net?</p>
<p>16:00 &lt;+bla&gt; Would it be a good idea to show some default examples for the location in http://localhost:7657/syndie/syndicate.jsp ?</p>
<p>16:00 &lt; jrandom&gt; syndiemedia.i2p.net is CVS head, yeah</p>
<p>16:00 &lt;+Complication&gt; When you've opened up a thread, and are currently reading its posts... and then choose to apply a filter to which no posts match (e.g. open thread "Syndie threading", apply filter "i2p.i2phex")...</p>
<p>16:00 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, perhaps bla.  new installs will have the three defaults in there, but examples would be good</p>
<p>16:01 &lt;@cervantes&gt; (the actual thread's tree needs to fully open too though)</p>
<p>16:01 &lt;+Complication&gt; ...it appears to leave the current posts displayed, as if they were matching or something...</p>
<p>16:01 &lt;+Complication&gt; Despite me definitely clicking the "Go" button.</p>
<p>16:01 &lt;@cervantes&gt; Complication: yeah I found that confusing too</p>
<p>16:02 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm Complication, the general idea was to let you browse around while still looking at a post, but perhaps it'd be best to drop the posts being displayed</p>
<p>16:02 &lt; jrandom&gt; cervantes: ah, yeah expanding it to the leaf would be good, and should be trivial to do</p>
<p>16:02 &lt;+Complication&gt; Just noticed, and since it stuck out, thought I'd tell</p>
<p>16:02 &lt;@cervantes&gt; (or make it more obvious that there aren't any matches)</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; well, the thread nav says *no matches* :)</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; ailouros&gt; perhaps he's looking for a lighter</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; !thwap</p>
<p>16:03 &lt;@cervantes&gt; (or make it even more obvious that there aren't any matches)</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; &lt;blink&gt;No matches&lt;/blink&gt;</p>
<p>16:03 &lt;+Complication&gt; Oops :)</p>
<p>16:04 &lt; tethra&gt; seems your !thwap got spaetz__ instead, jr!</p>
<p>16:04 &lt;+Complication&gt; Right, sometimes the thread navigator *does* feel a long distance away :)</p>
<p>16:04 &lt; jrandom&gt; yeah, we're experimenting with some css to float that down the side, as an option</p>
<p>16:05 &lt;@cervantes&gt; with skinning support you could have the thread top buttom left right etc</p>
<p>16:05 &lt;@cervantes&gt; ah as jr said</p>
<p>16:05 &lt;+Complication&gt; The "Threads" link takes one there fairly quick, though</p>
<p>16:05 &lt;+Complication&gt; ...if it's within the viewport currently.</p>
<p>16:06 &lt;+Complication&gt; And those who are used to keyboard-navigating can naturally press "End"</p>
<p>16:06 &lt; jrandom&gt; of course, this stuff is really simple to modify (as you can see from the rapid changes in CVS :), so if anyone has any suggestions (or mockups - html / png / etc), please, post 'em up whenever</p>
<p>16:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; I expect we'll have a main blog overview page in the next few days in cvs</p>
<p>16:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, there's lots of other stuff going on w/ syndie, so swing on by http://localhost:7657/syndie/ for more info :)</p>
<p>16:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else to bring up on that, or shall we move on to 5) ???</p>
<p>16:09 &lt; zzz&gt; hi just walked in. on 2), I'm looking for testers for my patch.  </p>
<p>16:10 &lt; zzz&gt; My results are improvements in job lag and reliability, and reduction in router hangs. So hoping others will try.</p>
<p>16:10 &lt; ailouros&gt; that sounds good enough. what do I have to do?</p>
<p>16:11 &lt; jrandom&gt; heya zzz, ok cool, i'll be bashing it around a bit here too.  its got lots of different components to it, so might be worth splitting up into pieces, but it does look good and is on track for 0.6.1.8</p>
<p>16:11 &lt; ailouros&gt; (average uptime is about 10h here :(</p>
<p>16:11 &lt; zzz&gt; If  you have source code and ant just apply the patch - or I can put up an i2pupdate.zip if you want</p>
<p>16:12 &lt; zzz&gt; jrandom I'll work on splitting it up</p>
<p>16:12 &lt; ailouros&gt; I'll go for the update, thanks</p>
<p>16:13 &lt; zzz&gt; ailouros will put it on zzz.i2p within an hour - thanks</p>
<p>16:13 &lt; jrandom&gt; zzz: I wouldn't worry about it unless you've got spare time... I can read through the diff :)</p>
<p>16:13 &lt; ailouros&gt; thank you</p>
<p>16:14 &lt; zzz&gt; jrandom OK. There's some miscellaneous stuff that can easily be ripped out by either you or me.</p>
<p>16:16 &lt; ailouros&gt; I guess we're at 5) ??? now?</p>
<p>16:16 &lt; zzz&gt; jrandom other topic  was Router OOMs with i2phex and possible SAM  issues</p>
<p>16:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye ailouros </p>
<p>16:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; ah yeah zzz, it'd be great to track down whats up with SAM</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; ailouros&gt; j346, did you have the chance to check out my app?</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; what would Rule is if someone could jump on and take over maintenance of the SAM bridge, as I havent done any substantial work on it, and human hasn't been around for a while.</p>
<p>16:19 &lt; jrandom&gt; not yet ailouros, unfortunately.  was a bit unsure about how it worked, so I've got to read through the source first</p>
<p>16:20 &lt; ailouros&gt; feel free to ask</p>
<p>16:20 &lt; ailouros&gt; (and good luck on the journey through the source, it's a good definition for the word "mess")</p>
<p>16:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; hehe</p>
<p>16:21 &lt; zzz&gt; correction my experience has been OOMs when using i2p-bt, not i2phex. Happens after about 24 hours when running one i2p-bt and in a few hours when running two i2p-bt</p>
<p>16:22 &lt;+Complication&gt; Mine happened after some late-night stress-testing.</p>
<p>16:22 &lt;+Complication&gt; (during which, let it be noted, I saw 5-minute averages of 50 KB/s)</p>
<p>16:22 &lt; bar_&gt; could you please remind me what your app is/does, ailouros? my memory is good but short...</p>
<p>16:22 &lt;+Complication&gt; Incoming, that is.</p>
<p>16:22 &lt;+Complication&gt; Outgoing was limited to 35 KB/s</p>
<p>16:22 &lt;@cervantes&gt; Complication: I've never heard it called late-night stress testing before...</p>
<p>16:22 &lt; jrandom&gt; nice Complication </p>
<p>16:23 &lt;+Complication&gt; cervantes: well, one *could* call it semi-daily megaleeching then :P</p>
<p>16:23 &lt; ailouros&gt; bar_: it's a working proof-of-concept for a distributed filesharing app which shares common blocks among differnt files (as suggested by polecat)</p>
<p>16:23 &lt; bar_&gt; ah, right, thanks ailouros</p>
<p>16:24 &lt; tethra&gt; cervantes: heheheh ;)</p>
<p>16:24 &lt; ailouros&gt; you're welcome (if anyone wants to get the source, it's in c/c++)</p>
<p>16:25 &lt;+polecat&gt; ailouros: Be careful, the chance of two binary blocks being the same is sufficiently rare, I'm mostly talking about pure theory that would be unuseful in practice.</p>
<p>16:25 &lt; ailouros&gt; polecat, I agree. My best guess is that it comes useful when you get different versions of the same files</p>
<p>16:25 &lt; ailouros&gt; like, a movie which has a corrupted block</p>
<p>16:25 &lt;+polecat&gt; You could transfer blocks of zeroes at lightning speeds!  ("The next block is zeroes" "oh I have that already" "the next block is zeroes" "oh I have that already")</p>
<p>16:26 &lt; ailouros&gt; or an archive of other zip files</p>
<p>16:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; or e.g. modified ID3 tags, etc</p>
<p>16:26 &lt; ailouros&gt; exactly</p>
<p>16:26 &lt;+polecat&gt; True.  But an easy way to "fix" a movie with a corrupted block is to tell bittorrent to download on top of it.  Most clients will preserve the blocks whose hashes are the same, and overwrite the ones that are different.</p>
<p>16:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; archives of files probably won't work though, since they'd have to break on file boundaries</p>
<p>16:27 &lt; ailouros&gt; j636, that's why I want to implement LBFS's idea of splitting on data marks and not fixed block sizes</p>
<p>16:27 &lt;@cervantes&gt; the DC community used that method, by sharing file distributions in rarsets</p>
<p>16:27 &lt;+polecat&gt; What might be useful is to make a general binary error correction algorithm, then implement it on a huge scale.  All blocks could be "corrected" into each other, and you'd only have to transmit the correction data, which might be smaller than transmitting the block itself.</p>
<p>16:29 &lt;@cervantes&gt; and then searches are basedon tiger hashes of those rar parts</p>
<p>16:29 &lt;+Complication&gt; Nice thought... sounds difficult though :)</p>
<p>16:29 &lt;+polecat&gt; But just a hash-for-hash equivalent... you'd never find two blocks alike!</p>
<p>16:29 &lt; ailouros&gt; cervantes, what's a "rarset"? :D (except a "RAR file", that is)</p>
<p>16:29 &lt;+polecat&gt; Unless both sides already had the file, one of them corrupted.</p>
<p>16:29 &lt; ailouros&gt; polecat, uh?</p>
<p>16:29 &lt;@cervantes&gt; ailouros: a split rar archive, with parity files if necessary</p>
<p>16:30 &lt; ailouros&gt; cervantes: I don't understand the advantage of doing that</p>
<p>16:31 &lt;@cervantes&gt; it's main benefit was to add pseudo-multi-source downloading to DC</p>
<p>16:32 &lt; ailouros&gt; well, that's part of the block sharing mechanism between files, isn't it?</p>
<p>16:34 &lt; ailouros&gt; polecat: about the bittorrent overwriting of damaged files, what it doesn't buy you is when you're trying to get multiple versions at once</p>
<p>16:35 &lt;@cervantes&gt; your client only matches/downloads valid parts, if you have parity files you can also recover damaged parts </p>
<p>16:35 &lt; ailouros&gt; with my system there are no damaged parts (files are assembled only when the composing blocks are downloaded and re-checked)</p>
<p>16:36 &lt;@cervantes&gt; stuff bittorrent does by default, except that you can't search specifically for individual parts</p>
<p>16:36 &lt;+polecat&gt; Multiple versions aren't likely to have a single bit in common though... which is why they're so stupid.  Some jerk decides to re-encode the movie in postage stamp format, and gives it the same name.</p>
<p>16:37 &lt;+polecat&gt; Or another jerk takes random data and names it by the file you want to download.</p>
<p>16:37 &lt; ailouros&gt; lol that's correct</p>
<p>16:37 &lt;@cervantes&gt; exactly and rarset releases are immune to that...</p>
<p>16:37 &lt; ailouros&gt; but keep in mind that files from other networks (emule, kazaa, whatever) often come corrupted</p>
<p>16:38 &lt;+polecat&gt; rarset releases aren't immune...</p>
<p>16:38 &lt;+polecat&gt; You still have to figure out which rarset is the right one.</p>
<p>16:38 &lt; ailouros&gt; cervantes, how are rarsets immune to an idiot publishing random junk?</p>
<p>16:38 &lt;@cervantes&gt; (provided you have a reliable source)</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;@cervantes&gt; because a release group publishes hashes/distribution information</p>
<p>16:39 &lt; ailouros&gt; hahaha that's easy :D</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;@cervantes&gt; and stuff is marked as nuked if it's poor quality, folk remove it from shares</p>
<p>16:40 &lt; ailouros&gt; cervantes, that much my toy already does</p>
<p>16:40 &lt;@cervantes&gt; cool</p>
<p>16:40 &lt; ailouros&gt; you get the file descriptor from a trusted source, you multiget the file pronto</p>
<p>16:41 &lt;@cervantes&gt; sounds good ;-)</p>
<p>16:41 &lt; ailouros&gt; you don't get to sarch for files, but you can browse through each user's shared dire, so you can use a web crawler and cache the results</p>
<p>16:42 &lt; ailouros&gt; though I might add a search function sometime in the future if deemed necessary</p>
<p>16:44 &lt; ailouros&gt; I believe my toy, proprely developed into an app, can offer the caching and resiliancy the freenet people try to offer</p>
<p>16:44 &lt; ailouros&gt; as in static content distribution and caching</p>
<p>16:45 &lt; ailouros&gt; you read my blog, you cache it and offer it to other people when they want. you don't do anything more than leave the content there</p>
<p>16:45 &lt; ailouros&gt; don't like the content? delete it and we're all set</p>
<p>16:45 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm, so do you see it as a backing store that could be used for syndie?  </p>
<p>16:46 &lt; ailouros&gt; it CAN be used as a backing store</p>
<p>16:46 &lt; ailouros&gt; as it is now, you might even use it in place of jetty, in i2p default installations</p>
<p>16:46 &lt; jrandom&gt; e.g. attachments / links to [clunk hash="$foo"]my file[/clunk]</p>
<p>16:46 &lt; ailouros&gt; (well with a couple of minor changes :D )</p>
<p>16:46 &lt; jrandom&gt; heh</p>
<p>16:47 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, yeah, I definitely don't understand how clunk works... wanna post about it in syndie, or put up an eepsite?  :)</p>
<p>16:47 &lt; ailouros&gt; file hashes are downloaded on file request, and these hashes are automagically downloaded into the full file</p>
<p>16:48 &lt; jrandom&gt; right, but "down"loaded is a question of from where to where, etc.  an overal network architecture description would be helpful</p>
<p>16:48 &lt; ailouros&gt; I'll write a decent doc first, then publish it somewhere</p>
<p>16:48 &lt; jrandom&gt; r0x0r, thanks</p>
<p>16:48 &lt; ailouros&gt; downloaded from wherever you got the hash from</p>
<p>16:48 &lt; ailouros&gt; plus everyone else sharing these blocks</p>
<p>16:49 &lt; ailouros&gt; think go!zilla and download accellerator :)</p>
<p>16:49 &lt; jrandom&gt; I think you misunderstand how much I am confused</p>
<p>16:49 &lt; ailouros&gt; but transparent and within i2p</p>
<p>16:49 &lt; ailouros&gt; lol guess so :D</p>
<p>16:50 &lt; jrandom&gt; a very, very basic explanation of e.g. "you run a clunk client, download from a clunk server, get info about clunk peers", etc</p>
<p>16:50 &lt; jrandom&gt; do I use a web browser to query a clunk client?  or server?  or peer?</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; jrandom&gt; (thats how lost I am)</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; ailouros&gt; redo from 0 :)</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; ailouros&gt; you use your web browser</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; ailouros&gt; you connect to your client</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; ailouros&gt; you browse others' dir with your browser</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; ailouros&gt; you select which files to download with your browser</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; ailouros&gt; your client does the dirty work</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; ailouros&gt; you get the downloaded file back</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; ailouros&gt; is this better? :)</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok great, thanks - so the "browse other's dir" is done by your client querying their client and responding back with an HTML representation of it</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; ailouros&gt; exactly</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; jrandom&gt; (or pulled from some server/superpeer/etc)</p>
<p>16:53 &lt; jrandom&gt; coo'</p>
<p>16:53 &lt; ailouros&gt; all the dirty work (finding duplicates, multidownloads and so on) is done by your (local) client transparently</p>
<p>16:54 &lt; ailouros&gt; what you see is, basically, a directory tree and some fiels you can download</p>
<p>16:54 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool</p>
<p>16:55 &lt; ailouros&gt; to publish your data you give away your public (p2p) address</p>
<p>16:55 &lt; ailouros&gt; and to share files you copy them (or symlink them) to the pub/ directory (or some subdir). It's that easy</p>
<p>16:57  * jrandom will dig through the source further, and look forward to more info :)</p>
<p>16:57 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone else have anything for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:57 &lt; bar_&gt; umm.. what's the difference between publishing and sharing, if i may ask? does publishing push the data to some datastore?</p>
<p>16:58 &lt; ailouros&gt; bar_: sharing is giving the blocks to download. publishing is letting the world know what you share</p>
<p>16:58 &lt; ailouros&gt; publishing is a subset of sharing</p>
<p>16:58 &lt; bar_&gt; aha, gotcha, thanks</p>
<p>16:58 &lt; ailouros&gt; for example, if you have half of a file, you share it but don't publish it</p>
<p>16:59 &lt; jrandom&gt; how would people know they ould get those blocks from you then?</p>
<p>16:59 &lt; ailouros&gt; and you have full control over which files you publish (unlike emule where every downloaded file is published)</p>
<p>16:59 &lt; ailouros&gt; because each client periodically sends information to the network about which blocks he has to offer</p>
<p>17:00 &lt; jrandom&gt; coo'</p>
<p>17:00 &lt; ailouros&gt; sends to the network as in server (as is now) or DHT (future)</p>
<p>17:00 &lt; jrandom&gt; so its mnet-esque, with a block tracker</p>
<p>17:00 &lt; ailouros&gt; err mnet-esque?</p>
<p>17:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; similar to how mnet (mnetproject.org) works</p>
<p>17:01  * ailouros is reading mnetproject.org</p>
<p>17:02 &lt; ailouros&gt; well, you have just your personal spaces, no shared spaces</p>
<p>17:02 &lt; ailouros&gt; and you don't PUSH blocks around</p>
<p>17:02 &lt; jrandom&gt; yeah, its not exactly the same as mnet, but it similar structurally</p>
<p>17:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; its like mnet where everyone is too broke to have anyone host their data ;)</p>
<p>17:03 &lt; ailouros&gt; yep</p>
<p>17:03 &lt; ailouros&gt; :D</p>
<p>17:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone else have anything else to bring up?</p>
<p>17:04 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not...</p>
<p>17:04  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>17:04  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
