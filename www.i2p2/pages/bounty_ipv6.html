{% block title %}Bounty I2P IPv6 native{% endblock %}
{% block content %}<p>For a future of I2P and attract more people
into I2P I withdrawl the vuze bounty and offer a IPv6 bounty.
To claim this bounty, the I2P router needs to run full on native
IPv6 connections like it does on IPv4.

Note:
For bounties to be declared done and paid, we need the plugin AND the source.
Source and code need to be licenced under a free licence (free to change and 
free to distribute). To claim the bounty the author must not be paid by other
organisations or teams for this work (e.g. GSoC students are not valid).</p>


<p><i>Note 2: bounty amounts may be increased by further donations.  Do
you think these are important?  <a href="donate">Add in your donation</a>, 
marking the amount for the datastore bounty!</i></p>
