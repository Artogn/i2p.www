<h2>Review</h2>

<p>
While we aren't aware on any published research on the advantages of 
unidirecdtional tunnels,
they appear to make it harder to detect a 
request/response pattern, which is quite possible to detect over a 
bidirectional tunnel.
Several apps and protocols, notably HTTP,
do transfer data in such manner. Having the traffic follow the same 
route to its destination and back could make it easier for an 
attacker who has only timing and traffic volume data to infer the path a 
tunnel is taking.
Having the response come back along a different path arguably 
makes it harder.

</p><p>
    When dealing with 
    an internal adversary or most external adversaries, I2P's undirectional tunnels
    expose half as much traffic data than would be exposed with bidirectional circuits
    by simply looking at the flows themselves - an HTTP request and response would 
    follow the same path in Tor, while in I2P the packets making up the request 
    would go out through one or more outbound tunnels and the packets making up 
    the response would come back through one or more different inbound tunnels. 

</p><p>
The strategy of using two separate tunnels for inbound and outbound
communication is not the only technique available, and it does have anonymity
implications.  On the positive side, by using separate tunnels it lessens the
traffic data exposed for analysis to participants in a tunnel - for instance,
peers in an outbound tunnel from a web browser would only see the traffic of
an HTTP GET, while the peers in an inbound tunnel would see the payload 
delivered along the tunnel.  With bidirectional tunnels, all participants would
have access to the fact that e.g. 1KB was sent in one direction, then 100KB
in the other.  On the negative side, using unidirectional tunnels means that
there are two sets of peers which need to be profiled and accounted for, and
additional care must be taken to address the increased speed of predecessor
attacks.  The tunnel pooling and building process
(peer selection and ordering strategies)
should minimize the worries of the predecessor attack.

<h2>Anonymity</h2>

<p>
A recent
<a href="http://grothoff.org/christian/i2p.pdf">paper by Hermann and Grothoff</a>
declared that I2P's unidirectional tunnels "seems to be a bad design decision".

The paper's main point is that
deanonymizations on unidirectional tunnels take a longer time, which is an 
advantage, but that an attacker can be more certain in the unidirectional case. 
Therefore, the paper claims it isn't an advantage at all, but a disadvantage, at least
with long-living eepsites.

</p><p>
This conclusion is not fully supported by the paper. Unidirectional tunnels clearly 
mitigate other attacks and it's not clear how to trade off the risk of the 
attack in the paper
with attacks on a bidirectional tunnel architecture.

</p><p>
This conclusion is based on an arbitrary certainty vs. time weighting 
(tradeoff) that may not be applicable in all cases. For 
example, somebody could make a list of possible IPs then issue subpoenas to 
each. Or the attacher couuld DDoS each in turn and via a simple 
intersection attack see if the eepsite goes down or is slowed down. So close 
may be good enough, or time may be more important.

The conclusion is based on a specific weighting of the importance of certainty 
vs. time, and that weighting may be wrong, and it's definitely debatable, 
especially in a real world with subpoenas, search warrants, and other methods 
available for final confirmation.

</p><p>
A full analysis of the tradeoffs of unidirectional vs. bidirectional 
tunnels is clearly outside the scope of the paper, and has not been done 
elsewhere. For example, how does this attack compare to the numerous possible 
timing attacks published about onion-routed networks? Clearly the authors have not
done that analysis, if it's even possible to do it
effectively.

</p><p>
Tor uses bidirectional tunnels and has had a lot of academic review. I2P 
uses unidirectional tunnels and has had very little review. Does the lack of a 
research paper defending unidirectional tunnels mean that it is a poor design 
choice, or just that it needs more study? Timing attacks and 
distributed attacks are difficult to defend against in both I2P and Tor. The 
design intent (see references above) was that unidirectional tunnels are more 
resistant to timing attacks. However, the paper presents a somewhat different type of timing 
attack. Is this attack, innovative as it is, sufficient to label I2P's 
tunnel architecture (and thus I2P as a whole) a "bad design", and by 
implication clearly inferior to Tor, or is it just a design alternative that 
clearly needs further investigation and analysis? There's several other reasons 
to consider I2P currently inferior to Tor and other projects (small network 
size, lack of funding, lack of review) but is unidirectional tunnels really a 
reason?

</p><p>
In summary, "bad design decision" is apparently (since the paper does
not label bidirectional tunnels "bad") shorthand for "unidirectional 
tunnels are unequivocally inferior to bidirectional tunnels", yet this 
conclusion is not supported by the paper.
