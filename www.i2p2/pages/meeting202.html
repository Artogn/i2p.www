<p>16:02 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>16:02  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>16:02 &lt; jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-March/001338.html</p>
<p>16:02 &lt; jrandom&gt; y'all've had a few hours to read those (and of course to read the related syndie posts ;) so lets just jump in to 1) net status and 0.6.1.28</p>
<p>16:04 &lt; jrandom&gt; there's been a bunch going on in this front lately - zzz wanna gives us a rundown of whats coming in 0.6.1.28?</p>
<p>16:05 &lt;+zzz&gt; ok</p>
<p>16:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; lots of improvements in tunnel building and upstream performance, mainly benefitting those who have a lot of outbound traffic or are upstream-bandwidth-constrained...</p>
<p>16:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; like i2psnark users...</p>
<p>16:06 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'm getting good results in testing so looking forward to getting it out there to all...</p>
<p>16:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; [w3wt]</p>
<p>16:07 &lt;+zzz&gt; I have one tweak to make a parameter configurable, as requested by Amiga4000, should get that in soon.</p>
<p>16:08 &lt;+zzz&gt; And thx for the $$ offer, however please keep it in the bank.</p>
<p>16:08 &lt;+zzz&gt; EOT :)</p>
<p>16:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; r0x0r - added to halloffame.html :)</p>
<p>16:09 &lt;+zzz&gt; haha I'm famous now</p>
<p>16:10 &lt; jrandom&gt; the changes look pretty promising, and they do seem that they'll have their largest impact once its widely deployed</p>
<p>16:11 &lt; jrandom&gt; just bounce me a msg when you want me to pull the trigger and i'll get it packaged and pushed w/in a day or so</p>
<p>16:11 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything they'd like to bring up re: net status?</p>
<p>16:13 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets hop on over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
<p>16:14 &lt; jrandom&gt; lots going on here (as you can see if you're using syndie or following https://trac.i2p.net/timeline )</p>
<p>16:14 &lt; jrandom&gt; i expect we'll have a new 1.005a release in the next day or two (obviously not including the things we're discussing in (3) below)</p>
<p>16:15 &lt; TrevorReznik&gt; jrandom: do you have time for a short query?</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; if its for the meeting, certainly (if its on 2), now is good, if it doesnt fit the agenda, we've got 5) ??? for everything else :)</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; (if its not something for the meeting, hit me as a priv msg)</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; TrevorReznik&gt; ok ;) ill wait</p>
<p>16:18 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything for 2) syndie dev status?</p>
<p>16:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets switch to 3) Syndie GUI directions</p>
<p>16:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; as mentioned in the mail, lots going on in this direction - mk has put together some really interesting ideas and we'll likely see it in syndie sooner rather than later</p>
<p>16:20 &lt;+zzz&gt; call me a traditionalist, but I think the current multipane thunderbird-like i/f is pretty good</p>
<p>16:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm, with the multipane view, would that fit more with mk's mods than our current multitab interface though?</p>
<p>16:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; do you use the preview tab on the thread view now, for instance?</p>
<p>16:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; right now there's no choice but to go to the preview tab to see attachments, which I don't like - would rather just see the whole thing in the lower pane</p>
<p>16:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; sorry not conversant in the details of mk's mods so can't answer your other question</p>
<p>16:27 &lt; jrandom&gt; ah, so it would work better w/ mk's view (once we get it using the MessageView instead of MessagePreview down there)</p>
<p>16:27 &lt; jrandom&gt; oh, there's a screencap of mk's proposal up at http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/mk_max.png</p>
<p>16:27 &lt; jrandom&gt; mk: perhaps we could find a way to make the tree above vs. left configurable?</p>
<p>16:29 &lt;+zzz&gt; thunderbird used to give you a choice of 2 or 3 layouts for the 3 panes, but can't find it in the options atm</p>
<p>16:30 &lt; jrandom&gt; i remember reviewing their diagram for that, yeah</p>
<p>16:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; perhaps if we can find a way to get mk's "explorer" parentable cleanly in an arbitrary SWT Composite we could use it both via the current tabbed GUI as a tab and in the fullscreen mode as a screen</p>
<p>16:33 &lt;+zzz&gt; I like the tabs for the less-common stuff like options, syndication configuration, etc; I think that tabs combined with the multipane for the common stuff is good. imho anyway.</p>
<p>16:34 &lt; jrandom&gt; do you run syndie fullscreen or only in part of the screen</p>
<p>16:35 &lt;+zzz&gt; usually full</p>
<p>16:35 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm cool</p>
<p>16:36 &lt;+zzz&gt; but because I'm using a 1024x768 laptop these days... on my 1600x1200 desktop I wouldn't take up the whole screen</p>
<p>16:37 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, for all y-all watching in the background, please post up your thoughts and ideas whenever its convient for you</p>
<p>16:37 &lt; jrandom&gt; heh aye, makes sense</p>
<p>16:38  * jrandom is on an 800x600 net cafe box atm</p>
<p>16:38 &lt;@detonate&gt; hmm, i'm having trouble getting i2p working again</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; it's doing something, using lots of cpu, but the web console doesn't seem to ever start</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; i guess i could try running it in windows</p>
<p>16:39 &lt; jrandom&gt; anything in the logs?</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; not really, it just says that i need to reseed</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;@detonate&gt; are the logs quieter than before?</p>
<p>16:39 &lt;+zzz&gt; wrapper.log NPE's?</p>
<p>16:41 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if there isn't anything else for 3, lets jump on to 4) Feb bug harvesting contest results</p>
<p>16:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; congrats & thanks to void, Darn, and Anonymous!  </p>
<p>16:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; (and to everyone else who has helped out, of course)</p>
<p>16:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; bug reports help us track down these issues and make sure they get taken care of, so please keep 'em coming</p>
<p>16:43 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if there isn't anything on 4), lets jump to 5) ???</p>
<p>16:43 &lt; jrandom&gt; anyone have anything they want to bring up for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:45 &lt; bar&gt; there was someone asking in the forums why the graphs displaying bw seem a bit off</p>
<p>16:45 &lt; bar&gt; thought you might have an idea or two</p>
<p>16:46 &lt; bar&gt; (basically, they peak at 1.5 x max bw setting)</p>
<p>16:47 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, wasn't sure *which* bw graphs they were referring to (each of the graphs accurrately render the stat which they represent, from what i've seen)</p>
<p>16:47 &lt;@detonate&gt; nm, it's working again :)</p>
<p>16:48 &lt;+zzz&gt; it's the first 3 graphs on graphs.jsp, which seem much higher than the bw displayed on the left side of the router console, and for me are much higher than my configured upstream limit</p>
<p>16:49  * jrandom loads</p>
<p>16:51 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm, and that includes the upstream avg w/ burst in mind?</p>
<p>16:52 &lt;+zzz&gt; yes</p>
<p>16:52 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm, ill look into it</p>
<p>16:53 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'll investigate further, guess it doesn't ring a bell for you</p>
<p>16:53 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:57 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not...</p>
<p>16:57  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>16:58  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
