{% block title %}How Peer Selection Works{% endblock %}
{% block content %}<p>Peer selection within I2P is simply the process of choosing which routers
on the network we want our messages to go through (which peers will we 
ask to join our tunnels).  To accomplish this, we keep track of how each
peer performs (the peer's "profile") and use that data to estimate how 
fast they are, how often they will be able to accept our requests, and 
whether they seem to be overloaded or otherwise unable to perform what
they agree to reliably.</p>

<h2>Peer profiles</h2>

<p>Each peer has a set of data points collected about them, including statistics 
about how long it takes for them to reply to a network database query, how 
often their tunnels fail, and how many new peers they are able to introduce 
us to, as well as simple data points such as when we last heard from them or
when the last communication error occurred.  The specific data points gathered
can be found in the <a href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/java/src/net/i2p/router/peermanager/PeerProfile.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">code</a>
</p>

<p>Currently, there is no 'ejection' strategy to get rid of the profiles for 
peers that are no longer active (or when the network consists of thousands
of peers, to get rid of peers that are performing poorly).  However, the size 
of each profile is fairly small, and is unrelated to how much data is 
collected about the peer, so that a router can keep a few thousand active
peer profiles without any significant overhead.  Once it becomes necessary,
we can simply compact the poorly performing profiles (keeping only the most
basic data) and maintain hundreds of thousands of profiles in memory.  Beyond
that size, we can simply eject the peers (e.g. keeping the best 100,000).</p>

<h2>Peer summaries</h2>

<p>While the profiles themselves can be considered a summary of a peer's 
performance, to allow for effective peer selection we break each summary down 
into four simple values, representing the peer's speed, its capacity, how well 
integrated into the network it is, and whether it is failing.</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>The speed calculation (as implemented 
<a href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/java/src/net/i2p/router/peermanager/SpeedCalculator.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">here</a>)
simply goes through the profile and estimates how many round trip messages we can
send through the peer in a minute.  For this estimate it just looks at past 
performance, weighing more recent data more heavily, and extrapolates it for the future.</p>

<h3>Capacity</h3>

<p>The capacity calculation (as implemented 
<a href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/java/src/net/i2p/router/peermanager/CapacityCalculator.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">here</a>)
simply goes through the profile and estimates how many tunnels we think the peer
would agree to participate in over the next hour.  For this estimate it looks at 
how many the peer has agreed to lately, how many the peer rejected, and how many
of the agreed to tunnels failed, and extrapolates the data.  In addition, it
includes a 'growth factor' (when the peer isn't failing or rejecting requests) so
that we will keep trying to push their limits.</p>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<p>The integration calculation (as implemented 
<a href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/java/src/net/i2p/router/peermanager/IntegrationCalculator.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">here</a>)
is important only for the network database (and in turn, only when trying to focus
the 'exploration' of the network to detect and heal splits).  At the moment it is 
not used for anything though, as the detection code is not necessary for generally
well connected networks.  In any case, the calculation itself simply tracks how many
times the peer is able to tell us about a peer we didn't know (or updated data for
a peer we did know).</p>

<h3>Failing</h3>

<p>The failing calculation (as implemented 
<a href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/java/src/net/i2p/router/peermanager/IsFailingCalculator.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">here</a>)
keeps track of a few data points and determines whether the peer is overloaded 
or is unable to honor its agreements.  When a peer is marked as failing, it will
be avoided whenever possible.</p>

<h2>Peer organization</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, we drill through each peer's profile to come up with a 
few key calculations, and based upon those, we organize each peer into five
groups - fast, capable, well integrated, not failing, and failing.  When the
router wants to build a tunnel, it looks for fast peers, while when it wants
to test peers it simply choses capable ones.  Within each of these groups 
however, the peer selected is random so that we balance the load (and risk)
across peers as well as to prevent some simple attacks.</p>

<p>The groupings are not mutually exclusive, nor are they unrelated:  <ul> 
<li>A peer is active if we have sent or received a message from the peer in the 
    last few minutes</li>
<li>A peer is considered "high capacity" if its capacity calculation meets or 
     exceeds the median of all active peers.  </li>
<li>A peer is considered "fast" if they are already "high capacity" and their 
    speed calculation meets or exceeds the median of all "high capacity" peers.</li>
<li>A peer is considered "well integrated" if its integration calculation meets 
    or exceeds the mean value of active peers.</li>
<li>A peer is considered "failing" if the failing calculation returns true.</li>
<li>A peer is considered "not failing" if it is not "high capacity" or "failing"</li>
</ul>

These groupings are implemented in the <a 
href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/java/src/net/i2p/router/peermanager/ProfileOrganizer.java?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">ProfileOrganizer</a>'s
reorganize() method (using the calculateThresholds() and locked_placeProfile() methods in turn).</p>{% endblock %}
