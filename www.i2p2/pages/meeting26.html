<p>00:00 &lt; mids&gt; Welcome to the 26th IIP meeting
<p>00:00 &lt; mids&gt; I didn't get any agenda items from anybody, so I'll just propose my own:
<p>00:00 &lt; mids&gt; - Release of 1.1-final
<p>00:00 &lt; mids&gt; do you guys have anything else to add?
<p>00:00 &lt; hezekiah&gt; (I propose an agenda item: What's the current major feature being worked on in IIP 1.2 dev?)
<p>00:01 &lt; mids&gt; great
<p>00:01 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I have a couple suggestions for additions to anonymail
<p>00:01 &lt; mids&gt; ok
<p>00:01 &lt; mids&gt; Agenda:
<p>00:02 &lt; mids&gt; - What's the current major feature being worked on in IIP 1.2 dev
<p>00:02 &lt; mids&gt; - Anonymail suggestions
<p>00:02 &lt; mids&gt; - Release of 1.1-final
<p>00:02 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>00:02  * mids hands the microphone to hezekiah 
<p>00:02 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Also like to note a project that I'm working on that uses IIP
<p>00:02 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I have no clue. It was actually a question. :) Nop?
<p>00:02  * hezekiah hands the microphone to nop.
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; hi
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; welcome
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; ok on the agenda
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; mids take it away
<p>00:04 &lt; mids&gt; no, you tell what the status of 1.2 is
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; well
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; lots of grindy stuff
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; mainly taking care of the grunt stuff
<p>00:04 &lt; hezekiah&gt; (Ahmen!)
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; getting the core ready for hardcore decentralization and crypto, we're in the midst of deciding crypto libraries, we think cryptlib and GnuMP 
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; and are looking at a few possibilities for routing, either the listener route concept, or possibly chord type routing
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; and that's mainly it for right now
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; for 1.2
<p>00:05 &lt; mids&gt; cool
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; 1.1 status, is if no one has any bugs in a weeks time
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; then we will probably move to defcon 1.1
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; meaning 1.1 Release
<p>00:06 &lt; mids&gt; stick to the agenda nop
<p>00:06 &lt; mids&gt; anonymail features are first
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; I didn't see an agenda
<p>00:06 &lt; mids&gt; :p
<p>00:06 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Mids, behave! :)
<p>00:06 &lt; hezekiah&gt; ;-)
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; I guess anonymail suggestions
<p>00:06 &lt; mids&gt; - Anonymail suggestions
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; take it away whoever that was
<p>00:06 &lt; mids&gt; FillaMent?
<p>00:06 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Okay, I just have two quick ones...
<p>00:07 &lt; FillaMent&gt; 1) Some sort of escape character to do \n's.
<p>00:07 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yeah!
<p>00:07 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Discuss or move on to #2?
<p>00:07 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Perhaps, "\n" for a newline, and "\\n" for a literal, "\n".
<p>00:08 &lt; mids&gt; what character do you suggest?
<p>00:08 &lt; mids&gt; ok
<p>00:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; (Like how you would do in C with printf.)
<p>00:08 &lt; FillaMent&gt; C, Perl, Java....
<p>00:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; C++ ... :)
<p>00:08 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Nah, make it vbCRLF
<p>00:08 &lt; mids&gt; and \\\\n for literal \\n :)
<p>00:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yup1
<p>00:08 &lt; mids&gt; vbCRLF?
<p>00:09 &lt; FillaMent&gt; visualbasicCarriageReturnLineFeed
<p>00:09 &lt; mids&gt; are you serious?
<p>00:09 &lt; hezekiah&gt; (I hope not.)
<p>00:09 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I used to hack vbScript (no, I'm not serious. \n is what everyone will be familiar with)
<p>00:09 &lt; hezekiah&gt; So, what was suggestion number 2?
<p>00:10 &lt; thecrypto&gt; damn wireless network
<p>00:10 &lt; FillaMent&gt; 2) Stripping non-plain text MIME garbage from mails that come from the internet and replacing it with something to the effect of &lt;One part MIME binary/word-doc stripped&gt;
<p>00:11 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Forgive me if I'm incorrectly implying MIME
<p>00:11 &lt; mids&gt; I dont really agree
<p>00:11 &lt; mids&gt; you should be able to receive RFC2015 compatible PGP signatures
<p>00:11 &lt; mids&gt; and stuff
<p>00:11 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yeah.
<p>00:12 &lt; hezekiah&gt; But changing Quoted-Printable to plain ASCII might not be a bad idea if it isn't already implemented.
<p>00:12 &lt; FillaMent&gt; And that's a specific mime type?
<p>00:12 &lt; FillaMent&gt; PGP sig I mean.
<p>00:12 &lt; mids&gt; it is
<p>00:12 &lt; hezekiah&gt; There are OpenPGP sigs that have a mime type.
<p>00:12 &lt; mids&gt; I can understand that it will be a lot of work to do MIME right
<p>00:13 &lt; mids&gt; since there are a lot of MIME types
<p>00:13 &lt; mids&gt; and browsers who violate it
<p>00:14 &lt; hezekiah&gt; "2) Stripping non-plain text MIME ..." (Wouldn't they be in base64 if they aren't plain ASCII anyway? And if not, then couldn't they just be converted?)
<p>00:14 &lt; mids&gt; maybe we should just forward the suggestions to codeshark
<p>00:15 &lt; mids&gt; since he knows how the app looks
<p>00:15 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Or even, if it has to be stripped, you could offer an option to retrieve it (in base64 or 7-bit.) That way you can save it via copy-paste, and decode/read it on your hard drive.
<p>00:15 &lt; mids&gt; (he made it)
<p>00:15 &lt; mids&gt; and what he can implement
<p>00:15 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Good idea!
<p>00:15 &lt; FillaMent&gt; The other day I got a mail that was written with MS Outaluck/W3rd and it came in as multipart MIME. The first part was a plain txt version of the message, the second was an RTF will all the formatting Markup
<p>00:15 &lt; nop&gt; this is something
<p>00:15 &lt; nop&gt; that needs to be sent to anonymail
<p>00:15 &lt; nop&gt; oops
<p>00:15 &lt; nop&gt; codeshark
<p>00:15 &lt; mids&gt; yeah
<p>00:15  * FillaMent digresses.
<p>00:15 &lt; mids&gt; lets just pass it on
<p>00:15 &lt; mids&gt; and see what his imput is
<p>00:16 &lt; mids&gt; - Release of IIP 1.1-final
<p>00:16 &lt; mids&gt; my comments: got to check the sourceforge bugtracker
<p>00:16 &lt; mids&gt; but I dont think that there are any code bugs open
<p>00:17 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Not the last time I saw ... (checking now.)
<p>00:17 &lt; mids&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=651711&group_id=50945&atid=461514
<p>00:17 &lt; mids&gt; (files stored in wrong dir)
<p>00:17 &lt; mids&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=655568&group_id=50945&atid=461514
<p>00:17 &lt; mids&gt; (-h doesnt work)
<p>00:17 &lt; mids&gt; that option DOES work for me
<p>00:17 &lt; mids&gt; please check it
<p>00:18 &lt; mids&gt; and if it works for everybody, we got to mark that report as invalid
<p>00:18 &lt; mids&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=654147&group_id=50945&atid=461514
<p>00:18 &lt; mids&gt; (FreeBSD socket call)
<p>00:18 &lt; mids&gt; I dont have FreeBSD, someone with FreeBSD should check
<p>00:19 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>00:19 &lt; mids&gt; Also we should really really supply some script that people can put in their /etc/init.d/
<p>00:20 &lt; mids&gt; ping?
<p>00:20 &lt; hezekiah&gt; It looks like the guy who did the FreeBSD bug ...
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; ... already found and pointed out the problem.
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=50945&atid=461514&file_id=37660&aid=654147
<p>00:22 &lt; hezekiah&gt; That's the link to the patch file. AF_INET apparently needs to be PF_INET on FreeBSD.
<p>00:22 &lt; hezekiah&gt; The patch was simple:
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; 484,489c484
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &lt; 	// If statement added by wiht, since FreeBSD uses PF_INET.
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &lt; 	#ifdef __FreeBSD__
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &lt; 		sh-&gt;Socket = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &lt; 	#else
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &lt; 		sh-&gt;Socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &lt; 	#endif
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; ---
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; &gt; 	sh-&gt;Socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);//PF_INET);
<p>00:23 &lt; mids&gt; I see, but then I dont know why the original ifdef was there at first?
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; What do you think, nop?
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; The top section should be the new code. The bottom section should be the old.
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; that should work
<p>00:24 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yeah. The bottom is the old.
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; you should commit looks fine
<p>00:24 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Do you want me to write it up, commit, and label the bug as fixed, nop?
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; but why is it different
<p>00:24 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Apparently, FreeBSD requires PF_INET instead of AF_INET as the first arguement for socket.
<p>00:25 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I don't know why.
<p>00:25 &lt; hezekiah&gt; But, the writter said this fixed the problem. Commit?
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:25 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK.
<p>00:25 &lt; mids&gt; ok
<p>00:26 &lt; mids&gt; who can look into the filepath problem?
<p>00:27 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I don't get that problem. If I try and start IIP as a different user or not in ~iip it says it can't write the log
<p>00:28 &lt; mids&gt; ok, we got to check the reported bugs and report on that on the mailinglist
<p>00:28 &lt; mids&gt; lets try to do that this week
<p>00:28 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>00:28 &lt; mids&gt; The biggest problem is the scalability of IIP
<p>00:28 &lt; mids&gt; RC2 was kinda stable
<p>00:28 &lt; mids&gt; RC3 isnt
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; why?
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; Imho it is because the node.ref is so big
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; so a lot of potential bad node
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; nodes
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; it is really, anonymity vs stability
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>00:29 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I noticed that. But some of them are just slow, not necisarily bad.
<p>00:29 &lt; mids&gt; the problem is the lot of people Pinging Out
<p>00:30 &lt; mids&gt; the solution that I suggest is releasing RC3 with a minimal node.ref
<p>00:30 &lt; mids&gt; only 4 nodes or something
<p>00:30 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>00:31 &lt; nop&gt; I agree
<p>00:31 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Pardon my lack of design knowledge... IIRC uses relays like freenet and IRC, right?
<p>00:32 &lt; FillaMent&gt; node == relay
<p>00:32 &lt; mids&gt; they are more static
<p>00:32 &lt; mids&gt; once you connect
<p>00:32 &lt; nop&gt; well
<p>00:32 &lt; nop&gt; at least in 1.1
<p>00:32 &lt; mids&gt; you stay connected through them for the same session
<p>00:32 &lt; nop&gt; they won't be forever
<p>00:32 &lt; FillaMent&gt; But, it's still one node passes to other nodes
<p>00:32 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:33 &lt; mids&gt; if you keep a big list of nodes, then the path is very long
<p>00:33 &lt; mids&gt; hence a lot of potential problems
<p>00:33 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Why not just make it so that it goes through the node.ref and picks a few at random, and keeps doing that. The user could maybe set the number. This would maybe distribute the load a little more?
<p>00:34 &lt; mids&gt; the current protocol doesnt support selecting the amount of hops
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; and we're not changing it in this version
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:34 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Okay, then it's outside my technical knowledge... what about the starting point?
<p>00:34 &lt; FillaMent&gt; or is the TTL the number or nodes in node.ref
<p>00:35 &lt; FillaMent&gt; s/or/of/
<p>00:35 &lt; mids&gt; each node connects to a node in its node.ref at random
<p>00:35 &lt; mids&gt; until it 'accidently' hits the server
<p>00:35 &lt; mids&gt; so if you have a lot of nodes
<p>00:35 &lt; FillaMent&gt; got it.
<p>00:35 &lt; mids&gt; it will have huge paths
<p>00:36 &lt; mids&gt; that is why I would suggest a manually crafter first layer of public nodes
<p>00:36 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Could another solution be to make 'the' server 'a' server?
<p>00:36 &lt; mids&gt; so you decrease the amount of hops
<p>00:36 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; Is there any sort of reliability-index-type thing?
<p>00:36 &lt; mids&gt; you only have 1 end-node
<p>00:36 &lt; mids&gt; there isnt, since you dont know what nodes a node connects through
<p>00:37 &lt; mids&gt; if your connection goes down, you dont know what node caused it
<p>00:37 &lt; mids&gt; it can be anyone on your path
<p>00:37 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; K.
<p>00:37 &lt; mids&gt; and you dont know your path
<p>00:37 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Is there anyway for the end user it increase the reliability of IIP?
<p>00:37 &lt; mids&gt; yes, manually edit your node.ref
<p>00:38 &lt; mids&gt; and put only some stable nodes on it
<p>00:38 &lt; mids&gt; and dont let it update the node.ref automatically
<p>00:38 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: I mean setting up a relay or something.
<p>00:38 &lt; mids&gt; ofcourse you dont know what are stable nodes, unless you have some inside knowledge about the IIP topography
<p>00:39 &lt; mids&gt; Trent for example directly connects to a node which connects to the IIP server node
<p>00:39 &lt; mids&gt; otherwise it would go down all the time
<p>00:39 &lt; mids&gt; resulting in a really bad network
<p>00:41 &lt; FillaMent&gt; To save me some time, where does iip store the nodes.ref on a linux box?
<p>00:41 &lt; mids&gt; ~/.iip/
<p>00:41 &lt; mids&gt; or the local directory
<p>00:42 &lt; mids&gt; ok, I want to quit this item
<p>00:42 &lt; mids&gt; homework for next week:
<p>00:42 &lt; mids&gt; think about the issues
<p>00:42 &lt; mids&gt; and propose suggestions to the mailinglist
<p>00:42 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Give me 10 min and I'll have a kludge for the massive node list problem
<p>00:42 &lt; mids&gt; or to a developper (if you arent subscribed)
<p>00:43 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>00:43 &lt; mids&gt; questions?
<p>00:51 &lt; hezekiah&gt; You almost have your "kludge" (I don't know what that word means) for the node list problem yet, FillaMent?
<p>00:52 &lt; FillaMent&gt; kludge is coding duct tape, and yes.
<p>00:52 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Ah.
<p>00:53 &lt; thecrypto&gt; the full definition is http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/kluge.html
<p>00:54 &lt; mids&gt; hezekiah: thanks for putting your hands on those 2 bugtracker items
<p>00:55 &lt; hezekiah&gt; No problem. I still don't know how to assign a bug to myself. Otherwise, I would have "officially" picked up the PF_INET one.
<p>00:55 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I couldn't find the button/link/whatever that lets you assign a bug to yourself.
<p>00:57 &lt; mids&gt; only project admins seem to be able to assign bugs for our project
<p>00:57 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Ah
<p>00:57 &lt; hezekiah&gt; That would explain it! :)
<p>00:59 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. Well, I'm going to leave now. Bye everyone! :)
<p>00:59 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; Good bye.
<p>01:04 &lt; mids&gt; ok
<p>01:04 &lt; mids&gt; I am gone too
<p>01:04 &lt; mids&gt; bye
<p>01:08 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; Everyone's leavin'?
<p>01:08 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; Is the meeting over?
<p>01:09 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I'm still here. Perhaps my time estimate was a bit off. I love/hate perl.
<p>01:10 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; What's perl got to do with it?
<p>01:10 &lt; FillaMent&gt; My node.ref kluge
<p>01:10 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; Ah.
<p>01:11 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I should just describe it to someone competant and let them do it in like 5min
<p>01:11 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; I'm just here for the heck of it.
<p>01:16 &lt; LeeroklaLacerta&gt; I'm going back to #anonymous.
<p>01:17 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Ha ha!
<p>01:39 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Anyone care to enlighten me as to why in perl, when I push an item into an array, /every/ item ends up being that item?
<p>02:59 &lt; sdgg&gt; hi
<p>03:05 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Know how long an md5 signature is supposed to be?
<p>03:10 &lt; sdgg&gt; 128 bits I believe
<p>03:14 &lt; sdgg&gt; Does anyone know of a good tutorial on c/c++ for *nix programming?
<p>03:14 &lt; sdgg&gt; Or somewhere I can look?
<p>05:10  * FillaMent is away: Destinking myself
