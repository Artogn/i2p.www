<h2>How to configure your browser</h2>
<p>Your browser will need to be configured in order to browse eepsites and to
utilize the outproxies available within I2P. On this page you'll find
instructions explaining how to configure some of the most popular browsers to
communicate over I2P.</p>

<h3>Outproxy Terms Of Service</h3> 
<p>
Remember: I2P was not designed for creating proxies to the outer Internet.
Instead, it is meant to be used as an internal network.
</p>
<p>
<b>The I2P project itself does not run any proxies to the Internet. Any such proxy
    services are run by by private volunteers and could be shut down or
    unreachable at anytime.</b></p>
<p>
By default, I2P comes with two outproxies configured: <code>false.i2p</code>
(an HTTP-only proxy) and <code>outproxyng.h2ik.i2p</code> (an HTTPS proxy
routed through Tor.</p>
<p>Both of these outproxies are configured with connection limits. This means
that only set amount of accesses are allowed per client. Once the limit is
reached, the client is blocked out for a timeframe of 1min/1h/1 day. Be
respectful and do not overload these services with too many requests!</p>
<p>Filtering is active on these outproxies (for example, mibbit and torrent
tracker access is blocked). Note that even though the pirate bay is blocked
they host an official eepsite at <a href="http://tbp.i2p">tpb.i2p</a>. Eepsites
that are accessible via .i2p addresses are also not allowed via the outproxies.
As a convenience, <code>False.i2p</code> blocks ad servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is good application to use as an
outproxy to the Internet.</p>
