<h3>Terms Of Service</h3> 
<p>
As always, some rules do apply on this service. Remember: I2P was not built to
create proxies to the outer Internet, it was always ment as a internal network.<br>
<br>
<b>The I2P project does not run any proxy by itself, all proxy services are run
by private persons and may be shut down/or unreachable anytime</b>. <br>
Two outproxy are setup on default installation: false.i2p as a http only proxy 
and outproxyng.h2ik.i2p as a http/https proxy pointing towards Tor. <br>
Both do have connection limits active, after a certain amount of accesses per time
the client is blocked out for a timeframe of 1min/1h/1 day. Do not overload
these services with to much requests!<br>
Also some filters are applied to these proxies. E.g. ALL tracker communication
is blocked and denied, also webpages like piratebay which do have a official 
I2P eepsite (tpb.i2p). False.i2p does block a lot of ads servers and some other
pages, too.

<p>
For the correct proxy config select the manual proxy configuration option and
enter port 4444 into the HTTP proxy box. Enter 4445 into the HTTPS section and
do not enter anything into the other protocol options as they are not supported
by I2P. Be sure you enter localhost and 127.0.0.1 into the "No Proxy for" box.</p>
