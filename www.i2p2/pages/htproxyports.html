<p>
For the correct proxy config select the manual proxy configuration option and
enter port 4444 into the HTTP proxy box. Enter 4445 into the HTTPS section and
do not enter anything into the other protocol options as they are not supported
by I2P. Be sure you enter localhost and 127.0.0.1 into the "No Proxy for" box.</p>
