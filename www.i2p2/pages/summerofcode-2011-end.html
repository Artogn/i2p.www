<p>itoopie and I2PControl are launching!</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce that itoopie and I2PControl are available publicly.</p>

<p>itoopie is a graphical interface intended as a compliment to the I2P Router Console.
The aim of itoopie is to provide an interface that is simpler and has a lower lurning curve than the I2P Router Console.</p>

<p>I2PControl is an I2P plugin providing a JSONRPC interface for the I2P router. The interface supports setting basic settings (bandwidth, ports etc.), reading many stats and is provided over an SSL encrypted HTTP connection.</p>

<p>More information and instructions can be found at <a href="http://itoopie.net">itoopie.net</a>, <a href="http://itoopie.i2p.to">itoopie.i2p.to</a> (via proxy)and <a href="http://itoopie.i2p">itoopie.i2p</a> (anonymously).

This project has been funded by the VPN services <a href="http://relakks.com">Relakks</a> & <a href="http://ipredator.se">Ipredator</a> and was initiated by Jan-Erik Fiske and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brokep">Peter Sunde</a>.

<p>Thank you Jan-Erik and Peter,
