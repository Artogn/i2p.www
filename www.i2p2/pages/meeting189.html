<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; 1) Net status</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; 2) Syndie dev status</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; 3) I2Phex mods</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; 4) ???</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:07  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001318.html</p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; (i'm late, so i'll let y'all catch up on those)</p>
<p>15:09 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump on in to 1) net status</p>
<p>15:10 &lt; jrandom&gt; [eom] :)</p>
<p>15:10  * jrandom has had a good irc connection now (4+ days), so things are in pretty good shape.</p>
<p>15:11 &lt; jrandom&gt; we've also got those new peer capacity graphs on stats.i2p, detailing some interesting ratios </p>
<p>15:13 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 1) net status?</p>
<p>15:14 &lt; striker&gt; just that it looks nice.</p>
<p>15:14 &lt; jrandom&gt; w00t :)</p>
<p>15:15 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, lets hop on over to 2) syndie dev status then</p>
<p>15:15 &lt; green&gt; I dunno U can have 4+ days conection on IRC,, I'm disconnected somewhat every 24h even with a router not so overloaded</p>
<p>15:15 &lt; jrandom&gt; green: unfortunately, its pretty arbitrary.</p>
<p>15:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; (or, more precicely, the cause is dependent upon many factors without a good control over them)</p>
<p>15:17 &lt; green&gt; any chance to really know why ?</p>
<p>15:17 &lt; green&gt; I've plenty of tunnels even where IRC goes down</p>
<p>15:18 &lt; green&gt; s/when</p>
<p>15:18 &lt; jrandom&gt; yes, there's lots we can do, but i'm focusing my time on getting syndie out first</p>
<p>15:18 &lt; green&gt; I know, so I've just to way more ;)</p>
<p>15:19 &lt; green&gt; s/wait</p>
<p>15:20 &lt; green&gt; gr f..ing keyboard</p>
<p>15:20 &lt; green&gt; ok, no more on 1 let's got to 2</p>
<p>15:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; w3rd</p>
<p>15:21 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, not much more to add beyond whats in the notes (well, that can reasonably be brought up)</p>
<p>15:21 &lt; jrandom&gt; the webcaching discussion thread is http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1958</p>
<p>15:22 &lt; green&gt; is there any plan on phpbb to syndie converter ?</p>
<p>15:22 &lt; jrandom&gt; and the latest mockup image referred to is http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/mockup/forum.png</p>
<p>15:23 &lt; jrandom&gt; green: hmm, i thought we discussed that in one of the meetings, but looking back at the logs, it occurred outside of a meeting</p>
<p>15:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; short answer: doable, and maybe it'll get done, but its not on the immediate roadmap</p>
<p>15:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; at least, not bidirectional phpbb&lt;--&gt;syndie operation</p>
<p>15:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; phpbb--&gt;syndie is easy (just suck in the posts, or use server side generation)</p>
<p>15:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; syndie--&gt;phpbb is easy too</p>
<p>15:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; i'm not sure if the phpbb model of operation is what people will end up using syndie for though</p>
<p>15:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; but we'll see</p>
<p>15:28 &lt; green&gt; even just an phpbb -&gt; syndie would be enough</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool, that'll be trivial (pulling phpbb's rendered html into a page & posting it).  a bit more complex would be pulling from phpb's database itself, though that'd give more control (but then only the phpbb admin could do it - the former method can be done by anyone)</p>
<p>15:31 &lt; badger&gt; phpbb's admin is fairly flat.... not a challenge to get a hook of</p>
<p>15:32 &lt; badger&gt; and there are various rss plugins available for it</p>
<p>15:33 &lt; jrandom&gt; ah cool.  actually, if someone wanted to start looking into that, it'd rule - just generate an HTML page (and if you need to reference other resources, do so with the syndie URIs [syndie.i2p.net/spec.html#uri] </p>
<p>15:34 &lt; jrandom&gt; (and if you need images/etc, just reference them as img src="attachment1" etc)</p>
<p>15:34 &lt; jrandom&gt; (and then we can shove 'em into a syndie post with no problem)</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; jrandom&gt; currently the message editor has "add text page" and "add html page" features... eventually we can toss in an "add page from the web..." that prompts you for a URL to fetch</p>
<p>15:37 &lt; badger&gt; http://forum.i2p/rss_news.php</p>
<p>15:38 &lt; badger&gt; translating that to syndie markup would probably be straightforward</p>
<p>15:39 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye (though remember, syndie markup /is html/.  the uris are just... long and hard to read :)</p>
<p>15:41 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev?</p>
<p>15:42 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets jump to 3) i2phex mods</p>
<p>15:43 &lt; jrandom&gt; strike1 / Complication: wanna give us an update?</p>
<p>15:43 &lt; strike1&gt; I did a quick sanity check in regards to solving the connect to self problem</p>
<p>15:43 &lt; strike1&gt; http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1965</p>
<p>15:44 &lt; strike1&gt; It seems to be working okay, but is merely preventing the local dest from being added to i2phex.hosts</p>
<p>15:44 &lt; strike1&gt; I am also looking into the hashing problems, and the downloading issues</p>
<p>15:45 &lt; jrandom&gt; kickass!</p>
<p>15:45 &lt; strike1&gt; The new mods in cvs seem to make for a slightly better i2phex so far too, I must say.</p>
<p>15:48 &lt; strike1&gt; Hopefully between Complication, I, and anyone else who wants to help we can solve them all soon. :)</p>
<p>15:49 &lt; jrandom&gt; wikked, thanks strike1 (& complication et al!)</p>
<p>15:50 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 3) i2phex mods?</p>
<p>15:51 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets jump to 4) ???</p>
<p>15:51 &lt; jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else they'd like to bring up for the meeting?</p>
<p>15:54 &lt; green&gt; any chance to have a dijjer port on I2P ?</p>
<p>15:55 &lt; green&gt; wow, don't worry, just a simple question ;)</p>
<p>15:55 &lt; jrandom&gt; probably not (dijjer port being a large number of public squid outproxies that cache)</p>
<p>15:56 &lt; jrandom&gt; but the ability to have content hosted when you're not online will be there with syndie</p>
<p>15:56 &lt; jrandom&gt; (and syndie can run over i2p)</p>
<p>15:56 &lt; green&gt; sure but how syndie can handle large content ?</p>
<p>15:57 &lt; jrandom&gt; technically, yes, but practically, no</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; green&gt; so using cache is not a so bad idea ?</p>
<p>15:58 &lt; jrandom&gt; otoh, we can have syndie distributed .torrent files for torrents that are encrypted with session keys that only those authorized on syndie know</p>
<p>15:59 &lt; jrandom&gt; there's a use case for caching large files, though i'm not sure if the freenet/dijjer caching method is the best route</p>
<p>15:59 &lt; jrandom&gt; (no pun intended)</p>
<p>15:59 &lt; green&gt; humm .torrent files so we have to rely on a cetral server / tracker</p>
<p>15:59 &lt; green&gt; s/central</p>
<p>16:00 &lt; jrandom&gt; (for instance, see http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#redblue )</p>
<p>16:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; green: torrents can be distributed, and you can put the same data on lots of swarms</p>
<p>16:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; but functionally, we know that torrents work for transfering truckloads of data</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; green&gt; There isn't so much goo tracker on I2P, so currently we rely on a central server even if it's doable to distribute torrent over a lot of tracker</p>
<p>16:05 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm, the trackers we have are good, there just isn't that much content :)</p>
<p>16:06 &lt; strike1&gt; I agree though looking at postman's tracker I was impressed with what I found there as opposed to last year.</p>
<p>16:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, quite</p>
<p>16:07 &lt; strike1&gt; Lots of nice stuff :)</p>
<p>16:09 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anything else for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:10 &lt; green&gt; (baf) :)</p>
<p>16:10  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>16:10  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
