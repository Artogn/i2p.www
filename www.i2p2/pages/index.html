<p>I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive
applications can use to securely communicate.  All data is wrapped with several
layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no trusted parties.</p>

<p>Anonymity is not a boolean - we are not trying to make something
"perfectly anonymous", but instead are working at making attacks more and more
expensive to mount.  I2P alone is what could be called a "low latency mix network",
and there are limits to the anonymity offered by such a system, but the applications
on top of I2P, such as <a href="http://syndie.i2p2.de/">Syndie</a>, I2P mail,
and I2PSnark extend it to offer both additional functionality and protection.</p>

<p>I2P is still a work in progress, and should only be used for testing or
development purposes prior to the 1.0 release.  Further releases beyond that
will add support for more hostile adversaries.</p>
