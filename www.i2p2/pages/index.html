<p>I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive
applications can use to securely communicate.  All data is wrapped with several
layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no trusted parties.</p>

<p>
Many applications are available that interface with I2P, including
mail, peer-peer, IRC chat, and others.</p>

I2P is growing fast! There were nine releases in 2009, and traffic grew by a factor of 5:

<p>
The I2P project was formed in 2003 to support the efforts of
those trying to build a more free society by offering them an uncensorable,
anonymous, and secure communication system. I2P is a development effort
producing a low latency, fully distributed, autonomous, scalable, anonymous,
resilient, and secure network. The goal is to operate successfully in
hostile environments - even when an organization with substantial financial
or political resources attacks it. All aspects of the network are open source and
available without cost, as this should both assure the people using it that the software
does what it claims, as well as enable others to contribute and improve
upon it to defeat aggressive attempts to
stifle free speech.
</p>

<p>Anonymity is not a boolean - we are not trying to make something
"perfectly anonymous", but instead are working at making attacks more and more
expensive to mount.  I2P is a low latency mix network,
and there are limits to the anonymity offered by such a system, but the applications
on top of I2P, such as <a href="http://syndie.i2p2.de/">Syndie</a>, I2P mail,
and I2PSnark extend it to offer both additional functionality and protection.</p>

<p>I2P is still a work in progress.
It should not be relied upon for "guaranteed" anonymity at this time,
due to the relatively small size of the network and the lack of extensive academic review.
It is not immune to attacks from those with unlimited resources, and may never be,
due to the inherent limitations of low-latency mix networks.
</p>

<p>
I2P works by routing traffic through other peers, as shown in the following picture.
All traffic is encrypted end-to-end.
