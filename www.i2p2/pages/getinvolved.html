{% block content %}<p>To get involved, please feel free to join us on the #i2p IRC channel (on
irc.freenode.net, or within I2P on irc.freshcoffee.i2p or irc.postman.i2p).
<p>If you're interested in joining our <a href="team">team</a>, please get in
touch as we're always looking for eager contributors!</p>

We need help in many areas, and you don't need to know Java to contribute!
Here's a list to help you get started!
<ul>
<li><b>Spread the Word!</b> -
Tell people about I2P on forums, blogs, and comments to articles.
Fix up the wikipedia article about I2P in your language.
Tell your friends.
<li><b>Testing</b> -
Run the latest builds from <a href="monotone.html">monotone</a>
and report results on #i2p or as bugs on <a href="http://trac.i2p2.i2p/">trac</a>.
<li><b>Documentation</b> -
Help fix the parts of the website that are outdated or incomplete.
Translate pages into other languages.
<li><b>Pictures</b> -
Make some more pictures, fix the old ones on the website
<li><b>Content</b> -
Make an eepsite! Add some content! Contribute to the community!
<li><b>Services</b> -
Run a service on an eepsite. It could be a proxy, a forum, a tracker,
a naming service, a search engine, an eepsite monitor... many of these
aren't that hard.
<li><b>Applications</b> -
Write or port applications for I2P! There's some guidelines and
a list of ideas on the <a href="applications.html">applications page</a>.
<li><b>Coding</b> -
There's plenty to do if you know Java or are ready to learn.
Check for open tickets on <a href="http://trac.i2p2.i2p/">trac</a>
or the TODO list on <a href="http://zzz.i2p/">zzz.i2p</a> for
some ideas on where to start.
See the <a href="newdevelopers.html">new developer's guide</a> for details.
<li><b>Analysis</b> -
Study or test the code to look for vulnerabilities.
Both anonymity vulnerabilities from the various
<a href="how_threatmodel.html">threat models</a>,
and DOS and other weaknesses due to securities holes,
need researching.
