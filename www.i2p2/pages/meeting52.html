<p>&lt;nop&gt;	ok, meeting started</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	what's on the agenda</p>
<p>--&gt;	logger (logger@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>--&gt;	Anon02 (~anon@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Tue Aug  5 21:03:10 UTC 2003</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Welcome to the Nth iip-dev meeting.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	What's on the agenda?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	Tue Aug  5 21:02:44 UTC 2003</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	synced to a NTP stratum 2 :)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Tue Aug  5 21:03:13 UTC 2003</p>
<p>--&gt;	ptm (~ptm@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Just synced to NIST. :)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt;	this sync does not help w/ iip delays ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	nop: things I want to see covered: java dev status, java crypto</p>
<p>	  status, python dev status, sdk status, naming service</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	(We're going into the naming service _already_?)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	not design you wanker, thats co's schpeel.  just talk about stuff</p>
<p>	  if there's stuff to talk about.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Ah</p>
<p>*	jrand0m puts LART away</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	anything else on the agenda?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	or shall we dig in?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Well, I can't think of anything else to add.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Ah!</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Oh!</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok.  java dev status:</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Good.</p>
<p>&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	ok</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	agenda</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	1) Welcome</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	as of today, there is a java client API with a stub java router</p>
<p>	  that can talk to each other.  in addition, there is an application called ATalk</p>
<p>	  allowing anonymous IM + file transfer.</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	2) IIP 1.1 blackouts</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	3) I2P</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	4) The End with comments and stuff</p>
<p>*	jrand0m goes back to corner</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	sorry</p>
<p>	  joeyo jrand0m Aug 05 17:08:24 * hezekiah gives jrand0m a dunce hat to wear in</p>
<p>	  the corner. ;-)</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	sorry about that</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	didn't see you started there</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	maybe I should go in corner</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	no worry.  item 1)</p>
<p>*	hezekiah hands nop a dunce hat too. :)</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	ok welcome everybuddy</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	blah blah</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	2) IIP 1.1 blackouts</p>
<p>--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	52nd iip-dev meeting and all that good rot!</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	the server recently had some issues with the hard drive sectors and has</p>
<p>	  been replaced</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	I plan to be moving the darn server into a more stable environment with</p>
<p>	  redundancy</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	and possibly lend out control of multiple ircd servers</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	dunno</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	that's something to be discussed</p>
<p>&lt;--	Anon02 has quit (EOF From client)</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	hopefully our servers should stay up now since the harddrive was replaced</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	sorry about the inconvenience folks</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	3) I2P - Jrand0m take it away</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	come out of the corner jrand0m</p>
<p>*	hezekiah goes over to the corner, pulls jrand0m off his chair, drags him</p>
<p>	  to the podium, takes away his dunce hat, and hands him the mic.</p>
<p>*	nop goes into that corner to fill his place</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol!</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sorry, back</p>
<p>*	nop grabs dunce hat from hezekiah</p>
<p>*	nop puts it on his head</p>
<p>*	nop applauds for jrand0m</p>
<p>*	jrand0m just watches the show</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	er... um ok</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: i2p, java status, etc. Talk man!</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so, as of today, there is a java client API with a stub java</p>
<p>	  router that can talk to each other.  in addition, there is an application called</p>
<p>	  ATalk allowing anonymous IM + file transfer.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	File transfer already!?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	si sr</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Wow.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm sure behind the times.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	but not the most graceful</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	it takes a file and tosses it in a message</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Ouch.</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	how long did 1.8 mb local transfer take?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I've tested with a 4K file and a 1.8Mb file</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	a few seconds</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	nice</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	:)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Does the java stuff do real encryption yet, or does it still</p>
<p>	  fake that?</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	fake</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	even I know that</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	:)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I warmed it up by talking to myself first [e.g. one window to</p>
<p>	  another, saying hi] so it didn't deal with the overhead of the first elg</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	right, its faked largely</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	most of the encryption is fake</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	that's being worked on though</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Of course. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	definitely.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	on that front, wanna give us an update thecrypto?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	well, right now i'm done with ElGamal and SHA256</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	right now I'm working on generating primes for DSA</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	I'll send out 5 and then we can just pick one</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: Didn't you have prime(s) coming for use with DSA?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	We also have some benchmarks on ElGamal and SHA256</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	And they are all fast</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	latest benchmarks w/ elg:</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Key Generation Time Average: 4437	total: 443759	min:</p>
<p>	  872	   max: 21110	   Keygen/second: 0</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Encryption Time Average    : 356	total: 35657	min:</p>
<p>	  431	   max: 611	   Encryption Bps: 179</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Decryption Time Average    : 983	total: 98347	min:</p>
<p>	  881	   max: 2143	   Decryption Bps: 65</p>

<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	min and max: are they in seconds?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	note that the Bps isn't really useful, as we only encrypt/decrypt</p>
<p>	  64 bytes</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	ms</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	no, sorry, those are all milliseconds</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Cool. :)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	And this is done in java?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	yes</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	pure java</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK. I am officiall impressed. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	100%.  P4 1.8</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	they are about the same on my 800 Mhz</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	How can I do the same tests?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sha256 benchmark:</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Short Message Time Average  : 0 total: 0	min: 0	max:</p>
<p>	  0  Bps: NaN</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Medium Message Time Average : 1 total: 130	min: 0	max:</p>
<p>	  10 Bps: 7876923</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Long Message Time Average   : 146	total: 14641	min:</p>
<p>	  130	   max: 270	   Bps: 83037</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	run the ElGamalBench program</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'll go find it.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(short size: ~10 bytes, medium ~10KB, long ~ 1MB)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	java -cp i2p.jar ElGamalBench</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(after running "ant all")</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: Thanks. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	np</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	The NaN thing means it's so fast that we end up dividing by 0</p>
<p>	  it's so fast :)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	What's the sha bench?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	java -cp i2p.jar SHA256Bench</p>
<p>--&gt;	Neo (anon@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	we'll probably want to move those to be main() methods of the</p>
<p>	  associated engines, but they're good where they are atm</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Let's see how fast all this is on an AMD K6-2 333MHz (which is</p>
<p>	  a chip not well know for its integer math.)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	heh</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok so we have DSA and AES left, right?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	this is all wikked thecrypto.  nice work.</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	yup</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	can I nag you for an ETA on the other two?  ;)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	If this is anywhere near as fast on my box as it is on yours,</p>
<p>	  you have to show me how you do that. ;-)</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	DSA should be done almost as soon as i have primes ready</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	hezekiah have you tried the sslcrypto for python</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	copying some code around from the prime generator and things like</p>
<p>	  that and it's done</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	the one off that link</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: sslcrypto won't do us any good.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: It doesn't implment ElGamal _or_ AES _or_ sha256.</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	AES is mostly done except that there is some error somewhere that</p>
<p>	  i'm still trying to pick out and destroy, once i have that, it'll be done</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	thecrypto&gt; so by friday, DSA keygen, sign, verify, and AES encrypt,</p>
<p>	  decrypt for arbitrary size inputs?</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	the one on McNab's site does not?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	yeah</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	darn</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	should be friday</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	most likey thursday</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	thecrypto&gt; does that include the UnsignedBigInteger stuff?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i'll be missing next weeks meeting because of summer camp, and</p>
<p>	  i'll be back after that</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	jrand0m: prolly not</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so for the time being, interoperability between java and python</p>
<p>	  is b0rked.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	for crypto, that is.</p>
<p>---	Notify: jeremiah is online (anon.iip).</p>
<p>--&gt;	jeremiah (~chatzilla@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(aka for signatures, keys, encryption, and decryption)</p>

<p>&lt;nop&gt;	hmm maybe we should focus more on C/C++</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	well, once we get it working completely we can then make sure</p>
<p>	  both java and python can speak to each other</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	while you're out I'll look into the unsigned stuff.</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	can someone email me a backlog? jeremiah@kingprimate.com</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: Give me a minute. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	nop&gt; do we have devs for C/C++?</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	I have one guy yes</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	and Hezekiah we know could do it</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	or perhaps we can get a python dev status update from hezekiah +</p>
<p>	  jeremiah to see when we'll have more people for the c/c++ dev</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	right, of course.  but hez+jeremiah are working on python atm</p>
<p>	  (right?)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Yeah.</p>
<p>&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm sort of giving poor jeremiah lots of trouble.</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	I was just saying if python won't be fast speeds</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Python is mainly for me to understand this network.</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	ahh</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Once, I get it to basically follow the complete spec, I intend</p>
<p>	  to hand it off to jeremiah to do with as he sees fit.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	It's not meant to be a killer implementation of the spec.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	(If I wanted that, I'd use C++.)</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	well there aren't any really processor intensive parts of the app,</p>
<p>	  iirc, aside from crypto, and ideally that will be handled in C anyways, right?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sure jeremiah.	all depends on the app</p>
<p>--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: In theory.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so where are we on the python side?  client api, local only</p>
<p>	  router, etc?</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	the python implementation will also let us know what optimizations</p>
<p>	  we could make from the start... I'd like to keep it up to date or, possibly,</p>
<p>	  ahead of the C implementation as I can</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: OK. Here's what I've got.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	In _theory_ the router should be able to handle all non-admin</p>
<p>	  messages from a client.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	However, I don't have client yet, so I haven't been able to debug</p>
<p>	  it (i.e. there are still bugs.)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm working on the client right now.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	'k.  if you can disable signature verification, we should be able</p>
<p>	  to run the java client against it now</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm hoping to have that done except for admin messages in a day</p>
<p>	  or two.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	we can test that out after the meeting</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: OK.</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	I've been dealing with real-world stuff mostly since the last</p>
<p>	  meeting, I can work on the client API, just been trying to sync my thinking</p>
<p>	  with hezekiah's</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	cool</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: You know what, just wait.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: I'm probably throwing in too much new stuff for you to</p>
<p>	  deal with right now.</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	hezekiah: right, what I was going to say is that you should</p>
<p>	  probably just go ahead and implement the base stuff</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: In a little while, it will be stabalized and you can</p>
<p>	  start refining it. (There are lots of TODO comments that need help.)</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	and then I can extend it later once I get the picture</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Exactly.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	You get to maintain all this code. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	cool.  so eta 1-2 weeks for a working python router + client api?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm going on vacation next week so probably.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Are we going to have more details on router to router soon?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	no.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	well, yes.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	but no.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	hezekiah: how long is the vacation?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	1 week.</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	ok</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(aka as soon as the SDK goes out, 100% of my time goes into I2NP)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm hoping to have all non-admin functionality written before I</p>
<p>	  go on vacation</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	but then soon after you get back you're off to college, right?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I2NP?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Right.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	network proto</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I have about 1 week after vacation.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Then I'm gone.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	And my free time drops like a stone.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so that 1 week should only be debugging</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	I can work on the code while hez is gone though</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	word</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	whats your summer look like jeremiah?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: Perhaps you can get those admin functions working?</p>

<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i'll still have a month after i come back from my vaction to work</p>
<p>	  on things</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	having a life, or being like the rest of us l00sers?  :)</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	maybe</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	100sers?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	What's a 100ser?</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	i leave for college on the 22nd, other than that I can dev</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt;	hezekiah: a loser</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	and the last week before I leave all my friends will be gone... so</p>
<p>	  I can go into hyperdev mode</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	mihi: Ah!</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	hehe</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK. So where were we on the agenda?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	i.e. What's next?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sdk status</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sdk == one client impl, a local only router impl, an app, and docs.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I'd like to have that out by next tuesday.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: That backlog is on the way. Sorry I forgot you there. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	thanks</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok, co isn't around, so the naming service stuff is prolly a bit</p>
<p>	  off base</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	we can discuss the naming service after he puts out specs or</p>
<p>	  he's around</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok, thats it for I2P stuff</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	anyone else have I2P stuff, or we on to: &lt;nop&gt; 4) The End with</p>
<p>	  comments and stuff</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I can't think of anything.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I assume everyone's seen</p>
<p>	  http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/08/05/anarchist.prison.ap/index.html ?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	not here</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(nop posted it here earlier)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	The thing about the guy who got arrested for linking to a bomb</p>
<p>	  building site?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	yes</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	relevence to the need to get I2P up ASAP should be aparent ;)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK! jeremiah, those logs are now sent.</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	thanks</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	anyone have any questions / comments / thoughts / frisbees,</p>
<p>	  or are we having a record breaking short meeting?</p>
<p>*	thecrypto tosses a frisbee</p>
<p>&lt;--	logger has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	damn y'all are quiet today ;)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt;	question:</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt;	where can non devs get yout java code?</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	si sr?</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	not yet</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt;	404</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	that'll be made available once we're release ready.  aka the</p>
<p>	  source will go out with the SDK</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	heh</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	yeah, we don't use SF</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: Is it possible that we can get anonymous cvs working some tiem?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	time?</p>
<p>&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	well, I would open up a non-standard port</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	hezekiah&gt; we'll have that once the code has the GPL license on there</p>
<p>&lt;nop&gt;	but I am working on viewcvs</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	aka not now since the gpl doc hasn't been added to the code yet</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: It's in all the python code directories and all python</p>
<p>	  source files speceify licensing under GPL-2.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	hezekiah&gt; is that on the cathedral?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Yes.</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ah word.  i2p/core/code/python ?  or a different module?</p>
<p>*	jrand0m hasn't seen it in there</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Each python code directory has a COPYING file in it with the</p>
<p>	  GPL-2 and each source file has the license set a GPL-2</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	It's i2p/router/python and i2p/api/python</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	'k</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so, yeah, by next tuesday we'll have the SDK + public source access.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Cool.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Or as you like to say, wikked. ;-)</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	heh</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	nada mas?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nada mas? What's that mean!?</p>
<p>&lt;jeremiah&gt;	nothing more</p>
<p>*	jrand0m suggests you learn a lil espanol en universidad</p>
<p>--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Questions anyone?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Going once!</p>
<p>&lt;--	ptm (~ptm@anon.iip) has left #iip-dev (ptm)</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Going twice!</p>
<p>&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (mr. flibble says "game over boys")</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Speak now .. or wait until you feel like speaking later!</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	okay, i'm going to be optimizing the elgamal even more, so expect</p>
<p>	  even faster elgamal benches in the future</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	please focus on DSA and AES before tuning... puhleeeease :)</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i will</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	The reason he's doing that is 'cause I'm causing trouble for</p>
<p>	  people again. ;-)</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i'm making DSA primes</p>
<p>--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>&lt;thecrypto&gt;	well, at least making the program to make DSA primes right now</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	ElGamal in Java doesn't like an AMD K-6 II 333MHz.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK.</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Question round is over!</p>
<p>&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok hez, we're done.  you wanna powow on getting the java client</p>
<p>	  and the python router work?</p>
<p>&lt;hezekiah&gt;	See you all next week citizens!</p>
<p>*	hezekiah smashes down the *baf*er</p>
