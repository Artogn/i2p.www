<p>15:06 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi<p>
<p>15:07  * jrandom waves<p>
<p>15:07 &lt;+fox&gt; &lt;mk&gt; I just made the post, so feel free to respond<p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-January/001331.html<p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; w3wt, shall do mk, thanks<p>
<p>15:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; (now lets get into our archived weekly development meeting :)<p>
<p>15:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; short set of status notes this week, but lets jump through 'em<p>
<p>15:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; 1) Net status<p>
<p>15:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; no real changes here, though we've had a substantial decline in build success rates as charted on stats.i2p<p>
<p>15:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; though not the catastrophic failures we saw last summer<p>
<p>15:09 &lt;+zzz&gt; yes, contrary to your rather sunny assessment in the notes, we hit a 3-month low in tunnel build success late last week. There has been only a modest recovery in last few days<p>
<p>15:09 &lt; Complication2&gt; On the net status side, I've seen some increased routing pressure, which has caused about 10% of bandwidth increase, but not much more<p>
<p>15:11 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, thats the odd part zzz - the failure rate has substantially incrased, but irc hasn't been substantially affected<p>
<p>15:11 &lt; Complication2&gt; It "feels" like a bit of significant routing capacity either recently left the network, or experienced downtime<p>
<p>15:11 &lt; jrandom&gt; Complication2: hmm, there were a few nodes with hardware and network trouble, which would correlate with that<p>
<p>15:12 &lt;+zzz&gt; from over $here irc was quite affected<p>
<p>15:12 &lt; Complication2&gt; but I found that my stat recorder has been recording 0B files since October... so I honestly don't know<p>
<p>15:12 &lt; Complication2&gt; had a typo in my script :O<p>
<p>15:12 &lt; jrandom&gt; d'oh<p>
<p>15:13 &lt; jrandom&gt; zzz: hopefully that has passed though, right?<p>
<p>15:13 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'd say things are improving although during evenings GMT things are worse than in mornings<p>
<p>15:15 &lt; jrandom&gt; hmm interesting<p>
<p>15:15 &lt; Complication2&gt; if most users are still from Europe, during evenings GMT, their count could be rising...<p>
<p>15:15 &lt;+zzz&gt; just remember weather is always sunny inside a colo :)<p>
<p>15:16 &lt; Complication2&gt; (but I haven't checked theland.i2p lately)<p>
<p>15:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; hehe<p>
<p>15:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; (we have had an increase in the last few days, with known: hitting 555 earlier this afternoon, and now sitting at 570)<p>
<p>15:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; ((active: 266/367))<p>
<p>15:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; at least, according to my router<p>
<p>15:18 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for 1) Net status?<p>
<p>15:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets hop on over to 2) Syndie status<p>
<p>15:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; some hefty stuff going on here, with a new release coming in the next day or two<p>
<p>15:21 &lt; jrandom&gt; i'm doing my best to clear as many of the bugs filed as possible, and there are two major functional improvements in the upcoming release - better handling for banning, and support for a whole slew of privacy, authentication, and authorization policies for various forums<p>
<p>15:23 &lt; jrandom&gt; when the new release is out though, there'll be more to discuss on that front (though most of that discussion is going on within syndie, naturaly :)<p>
<p>15:23 &lt; jrandom&gt; as for the contest - there's still one more day left to file your bugs!  the winners and supporters will be announced in next week's meeting<p>
<p>15:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have any questions/comments/concerns re: syndie status?<p>
<p>15:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not, lets jump on to 3) I2PSnark status<p>
<p>15:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; zzz, wanna give us an update on things?<p>
<p>15:25 &lt;+zzz&gt; yes<p>
<p>15:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; at the mtg 2 wks ago I was at a good stopping point, but then I found and fixed some real memory-eaters and made some other tweaks...<p>
<p>15:26 &lt;+zzz&gt; I'm now at a good stopping point again so folks please test CVS and report results here or in syndie - thanks<p>
<p>15:27 &lt;+zzz&gt; on the startup thrashing...<p>
<p>15:27 &lt;+zzz&gt; there were some good suggestions in syndie...<p>
<p>15:28 &lt;+zzz&gt; my first idea didn't really work, but I cleaned up a lock so that the web page doesn't hang at startup anymore, so it _looks_ faster<p>
<p>15:28 &lt;+zzz&gt; may stab at the other suggestions later. &lt;eot&gt;<p>
<p>15:29 &lt; jrandom&gt; heh cool, thanks zzz!<p>
<p>15:30 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, lets jump to our good ol' catch-all: 4) ???<p>
<p>15:30 &lt; jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else tobring up for the meeting?<p>
<p>15:33 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if not...<p>
<p>15:33  * jrandom winds up<p>
<p>15:34  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed<p>
