<p>00:02 &lt;@mids&gt; Welcome to the 33th meeting
<p>00:02 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Hi
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; IIP 1.1.0 is released yesterday
<p>00:03 &lt; toni&gt; is it okay, to simply idle here and eve's drop?
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; toni: yes
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; Agenda for this meeting:
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; 1) IIP 1.1.0 
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; 2) Future of IIP
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; 3) Questions
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; if you have questions about the current subject, please ask
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; otherwise save it for round 3
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; hi
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; logs are available on http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/iip/
<p>00:04 &lt; hezekiah&gt; hi! :)
<p>00:04 &lt; luckypunk&gt; Hi.
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>00:04 &lt; jrand0m&gt; ev'nin
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; 1) IIP 1.1.0 (stable) Released!!!
<p>00:05 &lt; hezekiah&gt; YAY!
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; Finally
<p>00:05 &lt; luckypunk&gt; :)
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; almost a year after nop's post that it would be out soon :)
<p>00:05 &lt; FillaMent&gt; w3rd i$ b0nd
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; In this version the installation for Unix is enhanced, entropy generation is improved and a few bugs are fixed. 
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; We call it a stable release
<p>00:05 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: Is that list of changes as compared to 1.1.0 RC3 or compared to 1.0.0?
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; and it looks stable so far
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/invisibleip/iip/CHANGELOG
<p>00:06 &lt;@mids&gt; thats all I know
<p>00:06 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. :)
<p>00:06 &lt; hezekiah&gt; (It sorta sounds like it is a comparison to 1.1.0 RC3 or RC2.)
<p>00:07 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: it does, because nobody wrote what was updated before
<p>00:07 &lt; dm&gt; Should I download the Service Pack 2 for IIP if I'm using a cracked version of IIP?
<p>00:07 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: Ah ... Therein lies the tale! ;-)
<p>00:07 &lt; dm&gt; sorry, carry on.
<p>00:07 &lt; hezekiah&gt; dm: I'm not aware of any service packs.
<p>00:07 &lt;@mids&gt; the release is announced on our website, freshmeat, infoanarchy and frost
<p>00:08 &lt;@mids&gt; I did email a few other sites that had it listed
<p>00:08 &lt;@mids&gt; if you guys/girls know other places to tell...
<p>00:08 &lt;@mids&gt; please do so
<p>00:08 &lt; jrand0m&gt; nsa?
<p>00:08 &lt; toni&gt; i know, but im a total stranger to iip *g*
<p>00:08 &lt; FillaMent&gt; kuro5hin?
<p>00:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: Did you email that program archive that hosts it that was recently mentioned on iip-dev?
<p>00:08 &lt; toni&gt; heise.de german security/internet related site
<p>00:08 &lt; FillaMent&gt; jinx.biz
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: I did mail vipul's munitions
<p>00:09 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: OK! :)
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; kuro5hin requires a decent article
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; and they are very picky
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; but if you want to write something...
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; please do so
<p>00:09 &lt; hezekiah&gt; slashdot again?
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; toni: could you inform them?
<p>00:09 &lt; hezekiah&gt; They don't require anything super decent, and they mentioned us before. ;-)
<p>00:10 &lt; toni&gt; they also require articles, and i dont know how picky they are
<p>00:10 &lt; toni&gt; if somebody writes an article, i could translate it to german and email them
<p>00:10 &lt;@mids&gt; you could use the press release on http://www.infoanarchy.org/story/2003/3/10/23466/2065
<p>00:11 &lt;@mids&gt; and link the CHANGELOG to http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/invisibleip/iip/CHANGELOG
<p>00:11 &lt;@mids&gt; be sure to include a general description of IIP
<p>00:11 &lt;@mids&gt; I think we should try to do /.
<p>00:12 &lt;@mids&gt; we survived it before
<p>00:12 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: Note: You mention to view the changelog in the infoanarchy article, but you don't appear to provide people with a link to it!
<p>00:12 &lt; toni&gt; since im not really familiar with iip, i guess i can't give a decent description, but if you /. it, i could give heise a hint, they often take news from there and translate them
<p>00:12 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: yes, I forgot.
<p>00:12 &lt;@mids&gt; I'll mail their editor
<p>00:15 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK ... anything else on agenda item 1 (IIP 1.1 release) ?
<p>00:17 &lt;@mids&gt; did you all already submit a newsstory to /.?
<p>00:17 &lt; hezekiah&gt; No.
<p>00:18 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I haven't been with the project quite long enough to have a firm grasp of what has happened since 1.0.
<p>00:18 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Who wrote the last /. post?
<p>00:18 &lt;@mids&gt; we dont know
<p>00:18 &lt; hezekiah&gt; LOL!
<p>00:18 &lt; jrand0m&gt; hahah
<p>00:18 &lt; dm&gt; I think it might have been no_nick
<p>00:18 &lt; mihi&gt; is iip too anonymous? ;-)
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; yes :)
<p>00:19 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Well, I'll go hunt up the previous post, and see if I can come up with something. :)
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; ok...
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; previous one was a copy of the kuro5hin article
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; which was about nop's interview
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; Item 2??
<p>00:19 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yay! :)
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; 2) Future of IIP
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; we want:
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; DECENTRALIZATION
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; but who is going to do it
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; and how
<p>00:21 &lt; dm&gt; and is it possible.
<p>00:21 &lt; jrand0m&gt; and what will be lost.
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; If I may interupt: I just want to make sure nop and UserX and present and accounted for. This conversation will be pretty futile without them. :)
<p>00:21 &lt; jrand0m&gt; (aka centralized authentication - trent)
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; nop?
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; UserX?
<p>00:21 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah?
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Are you present?
<p>00:21 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: Here!
<p>00:21 &lt; nop&gt; I'm somewhat present
<p>00:22 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. :)
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; userx and I have had discussions
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; on how we would like to do it
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Did those get discussions written up in papers and stuck in the research directory of the IIP website?
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; ues
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; most are there
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; userx has more
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; that I would like pu t there
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; http://www.invisiblenet.net/research/IIP-WP-Notes.txt
<p>00:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. Could you please give the filenames of the most relavent ones so I can give them a look? :)
<p>00:23 &lt; nop&gt; that one contains quite a bit
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; there is also some other's contributed
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; IIP_netproto.html
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; and architecture.pdf
<p>00:24 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. :)
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; 
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; http://www.invisiblenet.net/research/IIP-Identity.txt
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; as well
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; http://www.invisiblenet.net/research/IIP-Messages.txt
<p>00:27 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. Are any of them completely (or primarily) devoted to just the decentralization aspect?
<p>00:27 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:27 &lt; nop&gt; all of them
<p>00:27 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. :)
<p>00:27 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Thanks for all the links! I'm checking them out now. :)
<p>00:31 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:31 &lt;@mids&gt; other IIP Future events?
<p>00:31 &lt; dm&gt; is FillaMent here?
<p>00:31 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Well, in the near future, IIP-dev still doesn't have the "entropy problem" fixed.
<p>00:31 &lt; dm&gt; he had the idea of making trent allow PGP key exchanges
<p>00:31 &lt; dm&gt; which makes sense.
<p>00:31  * FillaMent is present
<p>00:32 &lt;@mids&gt; yes FillaMent and me did talk about that
<p>00:32  * mids hands the microphone to FillaMent 
<p>00:32  * FillaMent taps it a couple times, "this thing on?" (sorry)
<p>00:33  * hezekiah turns up the volume
<p>00:33 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; :)
<p>00:33 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Here's the deal: I think it'd be handy to have a PGP key storage and exchange mechanism on IIP. I have a few proposals as to how such a thing should work.
<p>00:34 &lt; dm&gt; Should be fairly easy? Just add a field for PGP to trent, and add GET/STORE commands?
<p>00:34 &lt; FillaMent&gt; 1) Capability is built into trent. This presents a problem with most IRC clients sending strings that long
<p>00:35 &lt; dm&gt; ah, ok.
<p>00:35 &lt; FillaMent&gt; 2) Make trent able to pull a CHK from freenet and store the contents of that file as the Key
<p>00:35 &lt; FillaMent&gt; 3) Build a separate bot to preform 1 or 2
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; hmm
<p>00:35 &lt;@mids&gt; good points
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; the only issue
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; I have
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; with this concept
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; is how do we trust trent or any bot for that matter to handle pub keys
<p>00:35 &lt; nop&gt; without verification
<p>00:36 &lt;@mids&gt; well
<p>00:36 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Well, it could check and make sure the nick was reg'd and ident'd
<p>00:36 &lt;@mids&gt; it could be just as a keyserver
<p>00:36 &lt; nop&gt; the idea I'm thinking
<p>00:36 &lt; nop&gt; is it can do a verify to all major key servers
<p>00:36 &lt; nop&gt; as well
<p>00:36 &lt; nop&gt; so that it gets congruent info
<p>00:36 &lt; FillaMent&gt; nop: read my flog entry about psuedoidentity?
<p>00:36 &lt; nop&gt; link
<p>00:37 &lt; FillaMent&gt; SSK@WxBcPJd1ppZSZ~C8IJI-DHx94oIPAgM/fillament//
<p>00:37 &lt;@mids&gt; keyservers dont verify anything
<p>00:37 &lt;@mids&gt; they just store stuff
<p>00:37 &lt;@mids&gt; what you can do now with Trent
<p>00:37 &lt; FillaMent&gt; here's the short of it... what if your identity only exists in anonymous space? What can you verify?
<p>00:37 &lt;@mids&gt;  /squery trent nickinfo mids
<p>00:38 &lt;@mids&gt; see the comment line
<p>00:38 &lt;@mids&gt; it can contain anything
<p>00:38 &lt;@mids&gt; also urls etc
<p>00:38 &lt; FillaMent&gt; but short
<p>00:38 &lt;@mids&gt; so you could link to your PGP key
<p>00:39 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I'm just thinking of something to remove all the middle steps.
<p>00:39 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Looking at mids' ID comment, I see it lists a key fingerprint
<p>00:39 &lt; hezekiah&gt; It also lists the key ID. Why can't someone just get the key from a keyserver, and check the fingerprint.
<p>00:39 &lt; FillaMent&gt; hezekiah: What key server?
<p>00:39 &lt; FillaMent&gt; one on the internet?
<p>00:39 &lt; nop&gt; that's what I'm saying
<p>00:40 &lt; mihi&gt; how get a key up to a key server? anonymously?
<p>00:40 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; we just need a bot to fetch those
<p>00:40 &lt; FillaMent&gt; if your identity only exists in anonymous space, like mine... I don't want to leave a trail on the internet
<p>00:40 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Ah ...
<p>00:40 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK. I get it. :)
<p>00:40 &lt;@mids&gt; so a keyserver bot for IIP would be it
<p>00:40 &lt;@mids&gt; combined with freenet
<p>00:40 &lt; FillaMent&gt; that'd be sweet... just feed trent the fingerprint and it'll try to fetch the key...
<p>00:41 &lt;@mids&gt; currently freenet is too heavy to run on the Trent server
<p>00:41 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; mids, well, you could ascii armor the public keys
<p>00:41 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: Such a thing need not be built into trent, as my point 3
<p>00:41 &lt; nop&gt; well
<p>00:41 &lt; nop&gt; you could use a gateway mids
<p>00:41 &lt; nop&gt; like groovy
<p>00:41 &lt;@mids&gt; too unreliable
<p>00:42 &lt; someone&gt; why do you need freenet, again?
<p>00:42 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: If you wanted to make trent capable, just have it access one of the public freenet servers
<p>00:42 &lt;@mids&gt; why not let a user upload the key to freenet and give the url to the bot?
<p>00:42 &lt;@mids&gt; someone: for file storage
<p>00:42 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: Because it a few days it's gone if no one accesses it.
<p>00:42 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; mids, wouldn't it be more efficient to have a one huge digest of public keys used by people?
<p>00:43 &lt; hezekiah&gt; lonelynerd, mids: You could just add a the capability to assign PGP key ID's to a nick just like you can assign a comment.
<p>00:43 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I think the best solution is to have it not integrated into IIP. Someone writes it as a piece of software (hell, I could do it but am busy) then distribute the software. Anyone who wants to run an IIP keyserver, can.
<p>00:44 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; hezekiah, true, but you still need to fetch the pgp key
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; ok here's the funny thing
<p>00:44 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; FillaMent, sounds reasonable
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; things we can see
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; we trust
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; like the internet
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; yet it's insecure
<p>00:44 &lt; someone&gt; why not just have a bot upload nad download keys from internet key servers and store a fingerprint with trent
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; yet we have a cryptographic network
<p>00:44 &lt; nop&gt; and we don't trust a soul to run a pgp keyserver
<p>00:44 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; someone, that's what i suggested
<p>00:44 &lt; hezekiah&gt; nop: lol! :)
<p>00:45 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; nop :)
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; nop
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; you dont get it
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; I do get it
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; you DONT need trust for a keyserver
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; I'm joking
<p>00:45 &lt; FillaMent&gt; nop: Sure you do... one just has to put their pseudoidentity on line.
<p>00:45 &lt; FillaMent&gt; on the line
<p>00:45 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: Sure you do
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; it is just for storage
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; I know mids
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; I was just being funny
<p>00:45 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; users should ALWAYS verify fingerprint
<p>00:45 &lt; someone&gt; lonelynerd: so we don't need freenet, right?
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; and check web of trust
<p>00:45 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: I could just stick my key there and say it's nop's.
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; nop: good if you are funny :) but others might not understand it
<p>00:46 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; FillaMent, actually, what you wrote about pseudoidentity got me thinking. i'm wasting time and resources by having two identities on iip, one for people who know me irl and then this.
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; FillaMent: thats why you can stick the fingerprint on Trent
<p>00:46 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; someone, exactly, freenet is cool, but not needed this time
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; (you'll have to trust trent though
<p>00:46 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: Yes... and /how/ many people know about key fingerprints?
<p>00:47 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; someone, but somebody could still post compressed digests contain many keys
<p>00:47 &lt;@mids&gt; if they dont know, they shouldnt use PGP
<p>00:47 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: yeah.. let's alienate the userbase
<p>00:47 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; true
<p>00:47 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; :)
<p>00:47 &lt;@mids&gt; no seriously
<p>00:47 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I've already had this discussion 20x with zab
<p>00:47 &lt; hezekiah&gt; FillaMent: if they don't know enough about key fingerprints, then they probably don't know enough about crypto for me to trust that they haven't given away their key!
<p>00:47 &lt;@mids&gt; using PGP without checking fingerprints gives a false sense of security
<p>00:48 &lt; FillaMent&gt; hezekiah: And how do you sort those people out?
<p>00:49 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; FillaMent, that's tricky. far too many users use pgp insecurely
<p>00:49 &lt; hezekiah&gt; FillaMent: Tis the billion dollar question! That is very hard. :) 
<p>00:49 &lt; FillaMent&gt; If you tell people that they're too stupid to use crypto, they won't want to. They'll say, 'fuck it... I don't have time to care about privacy'... they may be sheep, but there are more of them voting than us. We have to make it easy for the sheep.
<p>00:50 &lt;@mids&gt; you can try to educate them
<p>00:50 &lt; FillaMent&gt; You have to get them in the classroom, and IIP/Fnet is the best classroom I know of
<p>00:50 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Correct, mids. Security is only as strong as the intelligence of the person behind it.
<p>00:50 &lt;@mids&gt; I totally agree FillaMent 
<p>00:51 &lt; FillaMent&gt; such a key storage bot would have a motd explaining that they should be checking fingerprints
<p>00:51 &lt;@mids&gt; I just think that you should seperate keyserver from trust
<p>00:51 &lt; hezekiah&gt; So what are we going to do with this bot and IIP? What do we want it to do, and how?
<p>00:51 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I think it should be a 3rd party thing
<p>00:52 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Like anonymail?
<p>00:52 &lt; FillaMent&gt; no... like something that anyone can run
<p>00:52 &lt;@mids&gt; anybody can run anonymail
<p>00:52 &lt;@mids&gt; IF you would have the source
<p>00:52 &lt;@mids&gt; :)
<p>00:52 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: You know what I mean though
<p>00:53 &lt;@mids&gt; yes
<p>00:53 &lt;@mids&gt; sorry
<p>00:53 &lt; hezekiah&gt; So is this something, the IIP developers need to write, or can someone who knows nothing about IIP but basic IRC can write?
<p>00:53  * FillaMent already has a framework going
<p>00:53 &lt; hezekiah&gt; OK! :)
<p>00:54 &lt; FillaMent&gt; well... I'd have to hack it to change it's direction
<p>00:54 &lt; FillaMent&gt; GAH!!!!!! More projects!!!! Nooooooo!
<p>00:54 &lt; jrand0m&gt; give in FillaMent, just give in
<p>00:54 &lt; FillaMent&gt; jrand0m: I know... I know.
<p>00:54 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Basically what I'm asking is, is this something that needs to get built into IIP, or can it be independant?
<p>00:55 &lt; FillaMent&gt; independent
<p>00:55 &lt; hezekiah&gt; If it's independant, then I'd say, "GO FOR IT!" :)
<p>00:55 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: IndependEnt
<p>00:55  * mids ducks
<p>00:55 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: really?
<p>00:55 &lt;@mids&gt; yes
<p>00:55  * FillaMent thinks he's missing a joke.
<p>00:56 &lt; hezekiah&gt; My spell checker says independant is OK.
<p>00:56 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah: made a typo
<p>00:56 &lt; FillaMent&gt; oh... yeah...
<p>00:56 &lt; FillaMent&gt; dent
<p>00:56 &lt; FillaMent&gt; independEnce
<p>00:56 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Hmmm ... it says independent is OK too, odd.
<p>00:56 &lt;@mids&gt; hezekiah:  grep "^independ.nt$" /usr/share/dict/words 
<p>00:56 &lt; FillaMent&gt; probably a new english/old english thing
<p>00:56 &lt;@mids&gt; anyway
<p>00:56 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Anyway ... :)
<p>00:57 &lt;@mids&gt; say we have this keybot
<p>00:57 &lt; hezekiah&gt; And it will be independent of IIP. :)
<p>00:57 &lt;@mids&gt; how will it get the key from a user?
<p>00:57 &lt; FillaMent&gt; /msg
<p>00:57 &lt;@mids&gt; the full key?
<p>00:57 &lt; FillaMent&gt; no
<p>00:57 &lt; FillaMent&gt; freenet
<p>00:57 &lt;@mids&gt; ah
<p>00:58 &lt;@mids&gt; so you msg the freenet url
<p>00:58 &lt;@mids&gt; and it tries to download in the background
<p>00:58 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; what's the problem? you can easily paste full key to iip.
<p>00:58 &lt; FillaMent&gt; /msg Keybot STORE CHK@lakdjfa;lsdfjasd;lkfj
<p>00:58 &lt;@mids&gt; lonelynerd: my key is 8 KB big
<p>00:58 &lt; FillaMent&gt; lonelynerd: Not will all clients
<p>00:58 &lt; mihi&gt; FillaMent: you can if you do it in blocks of 10 lines.
<p>00:59 &lt;@mids&gt; the keyboard _could_ look if you are identified with trent
<p>00:59 &lt;@mids&gt; keybot
<p>00:59 &lt;@mids&gt; :)
<p>00:59 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: It would have to
<p>00:59 &lt;@mids&gt; and just add that as an additional flag
<p>01:00 &lt; FillaMent&gt; /msg keybot MSGSTORE ad;flkjsflkjsdf;lasdrkfj
<p>01:00 &lt; FillaMent&gt; /msg keybot MSGSTORE ad;flkjsflkjsdf;lasdrkfj
<p>01:00 &lt; FillaMent&gt; /msg keybot MSGSTORE ad;flkjsflkjsdf;lasdrkfj
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; well
<p>01:00 &lt; FillaMent&gt; such a thing would best be scripted
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; yes
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; exactly
<p>01:00 &lt; jrand0m&gt; is a centralized identity manager like trent really desireable?
<p>01:00 &lt; FillaMent&gt; so either chopped and sent via msg or via freenet
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; jrand0m: with a centralized ircd, yes
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; maybe we should form a keybot commitee
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; and let them discuss the details
<p>01:01 &lt; jrand0m&gt; ah, right.  yeah, I was assuming a decentralized net.
<p>01:01  * mids opens #keybot
<p>01:01 &lt; FillaMent&gt; mids: I don't see a need
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; well
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; we got more on the agenda
<p>01:01 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; mids, uhm.
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; and we are already busy for 1 hour
<p>01:01 &lt; FillaMent&gt; 20 people start keybots... 1 will eventually prove the most reliable and become the defacto standard
<p>01:02 &lt;@mids&gt; I mean more.. any other Future IIP things?
<p>01:02 &lt; hezekiah&gt; nop?
<p>01:02 &lt; hezekiah&gt; What are the major features/changes you plan for 1.2?
<p>01:02 &lt; nop&gt; what
<p>01:02 &lt; nop&gt; decentralization
<p>01:02 &lt; nop&gt; and channel encryption
<p>01:02 &lt; nop&gt; as well as client to client encryption
<p>01:02 &lt; nop&gt; channel trust
<p>01:02 &lt; nop&gt; using RSA keyring
<p>01:02 &lt; Debolaz&gt; I have a question. What is the thing needed most from IIP now, that an ISP would be able to provide?
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; money!
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; millions
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; so we can hire thousands of developers
<p>01:03 &lt; Debolaz&gt; I was thinking more in terms of services.
<p>01:04 &lt; jrand0m&gt; OC12?
<p>01:04 &lt;@mids&gt; hosting is fine at sf so far
<p>01:04 &lt;@mids&gt; maybe a stable node somewhere
<p>01:05 &lt;@mids&gt; ...
<p>01:05 &lt; Debolaz&gt; Well, I was thinking of a node sort of thing. And perhaps a file mirror.
<p>01:05 &lt;@mids&gt; project release files are already mirrored on 8 servers so far
<p>01:06 &lt;@mids&gt; plus on vipul's munitions
<p>01:07  * mids slowly pushes the topic to item 3, questions
<p>01:07 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Ack!
<p>01:07 &lt;@mids&gt; 3) Questions?
<p>01:08 &lt; jrand0m&gt; eta for decentralization (1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo)?
<p>01:08 &lt; jrand0m&gt; aka, without dependence on a central server
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; no comment!
<p>01:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: LOL!
<p>01:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I really have no idea. UserX would probably have the best bet
<p>01:09 &lt; hezekiah&gt; nop, UserX: are we done decentralizing "core" in isproxy yet?
<p>01:09 &lt; nop&gt; um no
<p>01:11 &lt; hezekiah&gt; I'm assuming that "core" comes before ircd decent., right?
<p>01:12 &lt; nop&gt; first
<p>01:12 &lt; nop&gt; we have to make a virc 
<p>01:12 &lt; nop&gt; which is a virtual irc transport
<p>01:12 &lt; nop&gt; so that the irc clients can still talk to the core
<p>01:12 &lt; nop&gt; without ircd
<p>01:13 &lt;@mids&gt; roadmap anybody?
<p>01:13 &lt; hezekiah&gt; lol. I'm clueless. :)
<p>01:16 &lt;@mids&gt; *silence*
<p>01:16 &lt;@mids&gt; I heared that some wanted next meeting to be earlier
<p>01:16 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>01:16  * FillaMent rubs his legs together furiously but fails to produce the proper chirp.
<p>01:16 &lt; nop&gt; UserX can't make it at the time we have now
<p>01:16 &lt; nop&gt; because of work 
<p>01:16 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Ah.
<p>01:16 &lt; nop&gt; if we had it a couple hours earlier
<p>01:16 &lt;@mids&gt; what time would be better?
<p>01:16 &lt; nop&gt; this would be easier
<p>01:16 &lt;@mids&gt; 21:00 UTC?
<p>01:16 &lt; hezekiah&gt; If UserX would talk more we could really get some stuff done! :)
<p>01:16 &lt; nop&gt; that should work
<p>01:17 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Let's see ...
<p>01:17 &lt; hezekiah&gt; It's normally 23:00 UTC, right?
<p>01:17 &lt;@mids&gt; yes
<p>01:17 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yeah.
<p>01:17 &lt; hezekiah&gt; That should work for me. :)
<p>01:17 &lt;@mids&gt; 21:00 UTC it is
<p>01:18 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>01:18 &lt;@mids&gt; I am out
<p>01:18 &lt;@mids&gt; thanks for listening to me :)
<p>01:18  * mids bows
<p>01:18 &lt;@mids&gt; oh
<p>01:18 &lt;@mids&gt; before I forget
<p>01:18 &lt;@mids&gt; UserX, nop, hezekiah, thanks for your work on IIP so far!
<p>01:18 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: I enjoy listening to you.
<p>01:19 &lt; hezekiah&gt; mids: A pleasure! :)
<p>01:19 &lt; hezekiah&gt; All you guys make it worthwhile! :)
<p>01:19 &lt; jrand0m&gt; yeah, thanks for the updates.  I appreciate using y'alls software
<p>01:19 &lt; hezekiah&gt; (Note: I am a Yankee. No offense is meant if there are girls in the channel.)
<p>01:19  * FillaMent curses them for this network that consumes his free time.
<p>01:19 &lt; hezekiah&gt; FillaMent: lol! :)
<p>01:19 &lt; jrand0m&gt; heh
<p>01:20  * hezekiah picks up the "baf"er
<p>01:20 &lt; hezekiah&gt; *BAF!*
<p>01:20 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Meeting adjurned! :)
<p>01:22 &lt; mihi&gt; adjourned, you mean?
<p>01:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Over.
<p>01:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Done.
<p>01:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; End.
<p>01:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Dead.
<p>01:23 &lt; hezekiah&gt; The meeting is dead. Long live the next meeting.
<p>01:23 &lt; mihi&gt; ;-) logger is still living
