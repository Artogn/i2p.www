<div class="irclog">
<p>15:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; 1) Net status</p>
<p>15:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; 2) ???</p>
<p>15:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:09  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>15:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-March/001270.html</p>
<p>15:10 &lt;@jrandom&gt; while y'all read that massive missive, lets jump into 1) Net status</p>
<p>15:10 &lt;@jrandom&gt; the net seems to still work (woot)</p>
<p>15:12 &lt; bar&gt; got me a new udp connection high score yesterday, 244</p>
<p>15:12 &lt;@jrandom&gt; I don't have much more to add on that front - anyone have any comments/questions/concerns?</p>
<p>15:12 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ah nice</p>
<p>15:12 &lt;@jrandom&gt; yeah, I'm hitting peak values too, currently 338 SSU connections</p>
<p>15:14  * jrandom has also done some substantial i2psnark transfers, though not always at great rates</p>
<p>15:15 &lt;@jrandom&gt; I've seen some interesting cyclical variations on stats.i2p regarding tunnel selection though, but that'll be seeing some changes as .0.6.1.13 rolls out</p>
<p>15:17 &lt;@jrandom&gt; I've also been doing some low(er) bandwidth testing and optimization, and thats really whats currently holding up ...13.  I think we'll have some good stuff down the pipe, but we'll see how it goes</p>
<p>15:18 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, if there's nothing else on 1) Net status, lets move on over to the floor - 2) ???</p>
<p>15:18 &lt;@jrandom&gt; anyone have anything they want to bring up?</p>
<p>15:18 &lt;+Complication&gt; I have only record uptimes to report, and to add that build -6 is very conservative on accepting participating tunnels</p>
<p>15:19 &lt;+Complication&gt; (but I mentioned that already earlier)</p>
<p>15:19 &lt;@jrandom&gt; nice - its doing well with the lower peer counts still, too, right?</p>
<p>15:19 &lt;+Complication&gt; Peer counts have recently risen a bit, actually</p>
<p>15:20 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ah 'k</p>
<p>15:20 &lt;+Complication&gt; They are now more like 50...100</p>
<p>15:20 &lt;+Complication&gt; (generally more towards 50 than 100)</p>
<p>15:20 &lt;@jrandom&gt; oh, so still fairly low compared to before</p>
<p>15:20 &lt;+Complication&gt; The around-30 values seem to have been as low as it gets</p>
<p>15:21 &lt;+Complication&gt; But generally, it's doing fine</p>
<p>15:21 &lt;@jrandom&gt; great</p>
<p>15:26  * jrandom would like to take this moment for a brief shout-out to some recent contributors supporting I2P - special thanks go out to bar, $anon, postman, and the rest of the folks up at http://www.i2p.net/halloffame!</p>
<p>15:27 &lt;@jrandom&gt; contributions of code and content of course are critical, but financial support helps keep me out of the normal workforce and crunching on I2P fulltime, plus our varied infrastructure costs</p>
<p>15:28 &lt; bar&gt; me blushes, but thanks :)</p>
<p>15:28 &lt;@cervantes&gt; w00t</p>
<p>15:29 &lt;+Complication&gt; nice :)</p>
<p>15:31 &lt; ripple&gt; jrandom: pastebin.i2p...mission accomplished....</p>
<p>15:32 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ripple: thanks - it looks like it behaves as desired - on OOM, it dies a fast and horrible death, which the service wrapper detects and restarts the router</p>
<p>15:32 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
<p>15:34 &lt; tmp&gt; Yes, let's pray for the recovery of Betty.</p>
<p>15:34  * tethra prays</p>
<p>15:34 &lt;@jrandom&gt; your prayers have been answered - she's back :)</p>
<p>15:34 &lt; tmp&gt; Faith based I2P.</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; tmp&gt; Ok. ;)</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; tethra&gt; awesome</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; tethra&gt; XD</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; fc&gt; tmp: is that a transport protocol or what?</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; tethra&gt; anonymous prayer?</p>
<p>15:35 &lt;@jrandom&gt; betty == my laptop</p>
<p>15:35 &lt; tethra&gt; not even god knows who you are!</p>
<p>15:36 &lt;@frosk&gt; how about the new machine that bar so awesomely donated?</p>
<p>15:36 &lt;+susi23&gt; jr: you did not name it susi??? shame on you ;)</p>
<p>15:37 &lt;@jrandom&gt; the new machine is currently being assembled, an x86_64 (x2) box for windows, gentoo, and perhaps fbsd</p>
<p>15:37 &lt;@frosk&gt; cool</p>
<p>15:37 &lt;@jrandom&gt; (once its ready, expect some photos on my blog ;)</p>
<p>15:38 &lt; fc&gt; bsd! bsd! bsd! ;)</p>
<p>15:38 &lt;@jrandom&gt; susi23: the new one will need a new name... ;)</p>
<p>15:38 &lt;@cervantes&gt; susan!</p>
<p>15:39 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ;)</p>
<p>15:39 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, if there's nothing else for the meeting...</p>
<p>15:39  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>15:39  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
