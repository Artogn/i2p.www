<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 1) router status</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 2) i2ptunnel</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 3) im</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 4) 0.3 plans</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 5) time synchronization</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 6) ???</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; hello mihi, polo</p>
<p>&lt;polo&gt; hello !</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; hi jrandom</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; :)</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; hi</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; hi</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 1) router status</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 0.2.3.3 is out, and it seems to be working</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; still lots to do, of course</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but this should be the last 0.2 release</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 0.3 is going to add the peer profiling to allow routers to avoid bad routers</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (and 0.3.1 is a revamp of the transports)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; hola Ophite1</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; Heya.</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; so more overhead for 0.3?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; yes and no</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; it will have peer testing, but its going to be more focused</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; will we see a speed up with path selection?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; yes</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; there are those 'liveliness' calculators, and there will be new latency and throughput calculators added</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; plus people will be able to tweak their own preferences for particular peers</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; e.g. if you know you want to prefer peer X over peer Y, you will be able to give them a weighting bonus of</p>
<p>          some random points</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; will there be a clean shutdown? *g*</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; thats actually a good question mihi</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; i2p is getting to the point where it needs an admin interface.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; the longest Job thats holding up its operation is the GenerateStatusConsoleJob</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; which can now take up to 4-6 seconds</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (holding everything else up)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; that needs to go async and on demand.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but i dont want to write a web listener / etc.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; perhaps the reverse - a servlet that starts the router and communicates with it</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; you don't need a full web server. just when you see GET, return your data.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; you're right, that stuff should be in 0.3 as well.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; and when you see something else (like SHUTDOWN), do as you please. of course only from localhost ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; aww c'mon</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; then someone can make a nice admin program</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; you had some triggers by files, didn't you? are they documented somewhere?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; mihi [~mihi@ags9-d9ba536a.pool.mediaWays.net] requested PING 1072820995 from jrandom</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; those were in IDN, not the router itself</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but that might be a good way to go</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; its a trivially easy system</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; good idea, lets go that way</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (and i can just reuse that code :)</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; this magical filestuff starts to look like plan9</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; lol</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; but file triggers require polling</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right mihi, reading a directory every 30s aint that bad</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; but a ServerSocket#accept is cheaper.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; as it won't eat any time. (provided a good OS)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; okay, file triggers are better than nothing, sure.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; server socket would allow remote admin</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (when appropriate)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; dunno.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; something to be worked out.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (or if someone wants to jump on it and code... :)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; and server socket could deliver the routerConsole as well.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ok, 2) i2ptunnel</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; i2ptunnel still rules, and its looking like we want to add a socket based API to control it</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;anon&gt; aum's ic2cp2pc plans are off for now?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; yes, ci2cp is dead in the water, replaced with the socket based API to control I2PTunnel</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; I think I may be able to throw on that API in the next few days, so he can get churning on the impl</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; just use a socket, make in.readLine() and feed that line to runCommand() ;)</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; what does the api give i2p?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; pretty much mihi (except it formats the results and send them back in a standard way)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; with an appropriate "logger" to send the commands back.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; s/commands/results/</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; rsk&gt; it lets application developers build client and server sockets over i2p without dealing with I2CP's</p>
<p>          encryption needs</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right right</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; i2ptunnel /does/ have an overhead for situations where there are lots of i2ptunnels</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; regardless of the JVM</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; i2ptunnel clients create a new destination per client contacted, and the router will perform much worse as</p>
<p>          the number of local destinations grows.</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; ah</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; this is due to the anonymity needs of the network tied to how our encryption works</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; for applications who just want to open a tunnel or two to a peer, this new api will RULE</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but for applications that need to talk to lots of other peers, I2CP is the way to go.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (since that is a single destination, multiplexed by i2cp)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; I suppose its the old TCP vs UDP balance, in a way</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi&gt; do you have any thoughts, or some ideas for the future of i2ptunnel?</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; hows the work on the ip over i2p, or the vpn stuff going?</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; jrandom: someone write a good streaming api, and then lets i2ptunnel use it.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; same for naming server.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; perhaps add some sequence numbers if no one does the things above.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; which will mean an incompatible change.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; incompatible changes aren't bad, we're early in dev</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (if we could increase the size of of the IDs too to two or four bytes per side as well?)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; the streaming api will be an incompatible change nevertheless. and if i2p worked, we don't need sequence</p>
<p>          numbers.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; rsk&gt; on hold, until someone has time to run with it?</p>
<p>&#8801; rsk/#i2p thinks incompatible chages are the best kind</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right mihi</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; ID should be 3 byte atm, so why *increase* to 2 bytes?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi&gt; actually, I'd like to slowly deprecate mode=GUARANTEED and implement that in the streaming api</p>
<p>&#8801; mihi/#i2p too</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; leaving i2p = IP, not TCP or UDP</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; damnit I wish I had another 14 hours in the day.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; only 14? ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; aren't the 3 byte ids derived by both sides of the con?  or maybe i'm just confused</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; each side has an ID of 3 bytes, hovever, only one must be sent at a time.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; perhaps I'll implement the streaming API, rip out GUARANTEED, and add that socket controller next.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ah ok</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; see /apps/i2p/i2ptunnel/java/src/protocol.txt</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right right</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; btw, who misplaced that file *there*?</p>
<p>&#8801; jrandom blames eco ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; wait, naw, you put 'em there</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; didnt you?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; oh wait, no I imported them</p>
<p>&#8801; jrandom blames self for being stupid.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (la la la)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; damn.  ok, yeah, working on the streaming API and the socket controller will allow me to mull over the peer</p>
<p>          testing / profiling / selection manifesto</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; I'll post that in a few days for comment</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (and it'll get my head out of the router.  variety++)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi&gt; anything else on i2ptunnel?</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; not that i know</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; coo'</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (thanks again for taking the time to chime in on this stuff, I know you're busy with fiw and the rest)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ok, thecrypto isn't here, but he's making progress on the IM app.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (thats agenda item 3)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 4) 0.3 plans</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 0.3.0 ~= peer profiling stuff, and now it'll also include the streaming api and that socket controller for</p>
<p>          i2ptunnel</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but, if you couldn't guess, its not going to be released on jan 1</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; jan 15 is an outside possibility.  we'll see how things go.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 0.3.1 isn't a full month of work, so it may not need to get bumped.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; other than that, the roadmap is still pretty much on track and representative of where we're moving</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 5) time synchronization</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; a new faq is posted at http://wiki.invisiblenet.net/iip-wiki?I2PTiming</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi, you had a suggestion about the fourth option there (building our own in-i2p timing)?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; hi brawl</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; yep.</p>
<p>&#8729;&#966;&#8729; brawl is now known as eco_</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; hi guys</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; oh heya eco</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; you should connect 3 random nodes and remember the diff between the avg time and local time.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; we just discussed the streaming API / tunnel api</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; and then hack up your own getTimeMillis that corrects that.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; mihi: No, you shouldn't.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi&gt; so if an attacker creates 1000 nodes with the wrong time, everyone gets screwed</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (since avg would skew randomly in between)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; if an attacker creates 1000 nodes, everyone gets screwed anyway...?</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; wouldnt that be self corecting?</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; mihi: OK, 3.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; no, we should be able to handle that mihi.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; okay, then only use avg, if standard deviation is lower than 1sec or so.</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; if everyone has the same time your ok, even if that time is wrong, right?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; rsk&gt; if all 1000 nodes were in sync, but what if they're all random</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; only use times that are close enough together. if not, take 3 new nodes.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi&gt; right, we could implement NTP (which basically does what you say, using a series of candidate averages</p>
<p>          to iteratively close in on the correct time</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; but we need not care of everything (like ping latencies), as ntp does.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; if we did not, mihi, time would slowly creep backwards.</p>
<p>&#8801; mihi/#i2p thinks that is better than let users set their time individually.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; so anyone who randomly picks 3 of those skewed nodes gets sent onto their own private network?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; what about that third option -</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; i2p has a component that checks with a real NTP server via NTP or SNTP</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; if you have only skewed notes in your netDB, you are on that private net as well...</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; rather than reimplementing the wheel</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; while I partially like that one...</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; NTP isn't signed, it's subject to an MITM attack.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; or dns cache poisoning for, say, time.nist.gov</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right Ophite1, though with 200,000+ SNTP or NTP hosts, thats a large set to attack.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; we would definitely not sync of time.nist.gov.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; connections from i2p to the NSA's time server might raise a few eyebrows, ne? :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; and if an attacker goes after time.nist.gov, everyone everywhere is affected</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; heh</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; then we combine both. ask a "real" ntp server and your neighbor. if both say the same, it's okay.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; so even /more/ code ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but yeah, thats reasonable.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; That's interesting. And if they don't?</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; pick another ntp server?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; refuse the peer.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; try other ntp server and another peer.</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; until you have a match. then refuse all prev peers.</p>
<p>&#8801; mihi/#i2p types slower than jrandom :(</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; match within a certain threshold, say 1sec?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 1s would be good.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; accepting peers up to 30s or so (to deal with lag)</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; is 1 sec okay on HEAVILY LADEN connections?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 1s for syncing, 30s for comm.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; I've seen latency on DSL get to 5 seconds when doing evil things to it.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; with tcp or udp?</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; but then, in that case, that host might not be the one you want to sync time to anyway ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; udp.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; hmm 'k</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; you'd have thought it'd get dropped :)</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; I think that the problem is more letting the user know that there is a problem</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; duck&gt; that is true.</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; only after walking through big logs they see that their clock is off (if they find it)</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; Maybe. Sort of.</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; or that the port is already bound</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; an admin interface would be nice.</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; the world is better with everybody using NTP connected to their local stantrum (sp) 2 server</p>
<p>CTCP Cloaking is now [On]</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; perhaps we'll have a 0.4 release with a bunch of cleanups and end user things, prior to going 1.0?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right (stratum)</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; only windows clients are not likely to have that</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; but they are also not likely to be stable</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; windows has NTP</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; so who cares</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; duck: Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 include NTP.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; a shitload easier than with unix too</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; sync'ed by default to time.windows.com iirc.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; with drop down options for others</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; It's an essential part of Windows Product Activation.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; can't expire if you don't know the time :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; heh</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; no option at my university... all clocks are 1 hour to 5 hours off. but i might not be allowed to run i2p there</p>
<p>          anyway...</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; mihi: i2p should try especially hard to work in such a situation...</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; mihi&gt; awesome!  you can help test out the hidden operation :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; as an aside, I'm going to be doing some traveling this summer</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; i'll likely be offline, without my laptop.</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; sidethought: ntp.duck.i2p :)</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; Look at it like this: Brianna Kazaa downloads cool new anonymous filesharing client which her best friend</p>
<p>          told her was really cool and lets you chat to people secretly and stuff. Do we want to tell her that she</p>
<p>          needs to set her clock within 30 seconds (how will she get some?)? Or do we want it to just work?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; but I'm going to make sure I can still be on I2P with just public terminals.</p>
<p>CTCP Cloaking is now [Off]</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; no brainer Ophite1.  just work (with docs for geeks)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; duck&gt; bootstrap ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; and i2p will /not/ require root.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; That's my point.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; jrandom: would you run a router on a box you didn't have root to?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; so yeah, a mix between option 3 and 4</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; option 3.5 sounds cool to me ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; Ophite1&gt; i'd run a hundred of them :)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; option 3.1415926...</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (and move on to the next lab, run a hundred more)</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; Ooh. Pie. Tasty.;)</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; jrandom: I said you didn't have root on. Amateur. :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; lol</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; so thats basically where we're looking.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; until the time stuff is implemented, everyone should use option 1 or 2.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; for option 2, if someone could write up some docs, I'd appreciate it</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; that's acceptable for now as we are Not Yet Ready for Brianna Kazaa et al ;)</p>
<p>&lt;mihi&gt; jftr: i won't test "hidden operation". my univ account has already been disabled once and i don't want it</p>
<p>          another time blocked...</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; mihi: You are the best test we could possibly have.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; Ophite1 &gt; not for test.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 'k mihi, we'll find a way, and once its ready you'll be able to use it.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; OK, maybe not test. Some unis get shirty enough to chuck you out rather than just block you.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; I know someone at the most anti-filesharing pro-RIAA university in the USA. He runs a 2gbit dumpsite.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; lol nice</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; I appreciate that very, very few people are this ballsy.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ok, thats it for time synchronization.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; eco_&gt; hi.  any bt stuff you want to talk about?  {or save till next week}</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; but bear in mind the majority of the internet is in future probably going to become university/corporate.</p>
<p>          i2p might be banned. i2p might WELL be considered abuse by major ISPs. i2p will have to work anyway.</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; I have a few interesting ideas along that angle I will present at a future date.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; word</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; (transport)</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; i2p is considered abuse by major ISPs, read your contract</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; rsk: running a distributed proxy cache?</p>
<p>&lt;rsk&gt; running any 'server'</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; rsk: Not unless it relays to SMTP or WWW.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; running services of any time</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right</p>
<p>&lt;Ophite1&gt; rsk: Hehe, I have a solution to that ;)</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; jrandom: can give a brief update</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; floor is yours :)</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; i'm porting the java-based bittorrent client snark (www.klomp.org/snark) to get aquainted with i2p</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; first port runs on top of i2ptunnel, directly calling the java classes</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; current state: does work with 2 peers, things get messed up with &gt; 2, tunnels aren't cleaned up, so restarting</p>
<p>          is painful</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; eta: this weekend</p>
<p>&#8801; eco_/#i2p realises that this might be considered &gt; 2003</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; w00t!</p>
<p>&#8801; jrandom hacks time.nist.gov</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; a "real" port would probably cut the overhead of the tunnels, but that's a next step</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; cool</p>
<p>&#8801; eco_/#i2p gives floor back to mc jrandom</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 'k, I think that was it</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; 6) ???</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else?</p>
<p>&#8801; eco_/#i2p would like to express his thanks for the job well done by jrandom cs up to now</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; and that sleep has some use for home sapiens, though jrandom seems to prove this false</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ;)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; what are y'all's thoughts on meeting here as opposed to iip, until i2p is reliable enough?</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; personally, I'm tired of meetings being cut to shreds every week.</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;anon&gt; lilo sucks!</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; we might be shutting people out by going here</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; we are, I know.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; if we can get an iip&lt;--&gt;here bridge</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; IIP is shutting ppl out each day</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; that'd be good.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; right.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; iip is, unfortunately, unusable for a reliable development community.</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; http://banaan.zeelandnet.nl/open/changate.html</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; that is the code where eyeKon etc is based on</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; and while I like to go off coding on my own, y'all come up with really good ideas and do good stuff that is</p>
<p>          essential</p>
<p>&#8801; rsk/#i2p is writing a windows update script</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; theoretically it could connect to 3 servers and mirror each of them</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; word duck, perhaps I'll try to get one running on i2p.dnsalias.net</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ping flood from hell ;)</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; irc at duck.i2p was pretty good today, beat iip</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; agreed</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; dropped me a few times though.</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; perhaps it'll be more reliable next week</p>
<p>&lt;eco_&gt; it's in your hands :-)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; reliability probably won't improve until 0.3, which is ~2 weeks out</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (1 week to do the tunnel/streaming stuff, 1 week for peer profiling / testing)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; then there'll be whatever bugs that introduces :)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; though I should say I was really excited to stream audio from aum last night</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; and ardvark was able to stream for 42 minutes without buffering!</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; so perhaps we can be reliable enough</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; (my local router is phttp only, which is probably a slight cause)</p>
<p>&lt;jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else?</p>
<p>&lt;i2p&gt; &lt;duck&gt; cant thing of anything</p>
<p>&#8801; eco_/#i2p can't either</p>
<p>&#8801; jrandom winds up...</p>
<p>&#8801; jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
