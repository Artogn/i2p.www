<!-- file version 2013.01.15.01 -->
<p>To improve I2P's maintainability, we want to have a solid set of
automated unit tests for the critical code.  While we do have some
unit tests at the moment, they are ad-hoc and partly unfinished.  
This bounty is for someone to check the existing tests and move over
old ones to jUnit, automate their execution, extend them to provide 
better code coverage, and publish the report online.  Its a massive 
effort, but can be broken down into phases, listed below (phase 2 
must occur first, but further phases may happen in any order).
As this needs some reading of code, it is the best start point for
new devs to get a good overview of I2P code and coding. A good job
for college students, interns or anyone who is just interested.
</p>
<p>
Take care! Jobs and bounties shuffled a bit!
Phase 6,7 and 8 are still open!
</p>
<br>


<h2>Phase 1: <a name="jenkins">CI jenkins and IRC bot</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 500 &euro;</b><i> server runs and this section is blocked</i><br />

<p>
To collect this bounty, a continuous integration server (Jenkins,
old name was Hudson) must be set up and a connected IRC bot needs 
to set up in the channel #i2p-dev on IRC2p network to print out
results of build tests.<br>
The server needs to be run long term.
</p>  
<br>

<h2>Phase 2: <a name="sdk">Check existing SDK tests </a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 150 &euro;</b> paid to str4d <br />

<p>
To collect this bounty, the existing SDK tests must be checked 
and made to work again. The need to be integrated into the ant 
build scripts ("ant test"), and tied in with a code coverage tool (e.g. 
<a href="http://www.cenqua.com/clover/">Clover</a>).  The ant script
must be capable of generating test status results as a web page, 
which will be published online.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Phase 3: <a name="sdk_coverage">SDK test coverage</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 200 &euro;</b> paid to unittests dev team<br />

<p>
To collect this bounty, the automated unit tests of the SDK 
(i2p/core/java/src) must work again.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Phase 4: <a name="router">Router test migration</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 150 &euro;</b> paid to str4d<br />

<p>
As with phase 2, the existing unit tests for the router must be
moved over to the automated system.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Phase 5: <a name="router_coverage">Router test coverage</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 200 &euro;</b> paid to unittests dev team<br />

<p>
To collect this bounty, the automated unit tests of the router 
(i2p/router/java/src) must work again.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Phase 6: <a name="streaming">Streaming lib tests</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 300 &euro;</b><br />


<p>
To collect this bounty, a new set of unit tests must meet a 
measured code coverage of 90% of the streaming lib 
(i2p/apps/ministreaming/ and i2p/apps/streaming/).
</p>
<br>

<h2>Phase 7: <a name="coverage">Unit tests coverage</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 500 &euro;</b><br />

<p> 
To collect this bounty, all above unit tests must meet the 100%
coverage marker (except for log statements).
</p>
<br>


<h2>Phase 8: <a name="multirouter">MultiRouter simulation</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: 1000 &euro;</b> will be split in more sub-tasks<br />

<p>
To collect this bounty, the existing in-memory multi-router
simulation must be checked, made work again and extend to simulate
lots of routers in memory on a single machine. This bounty will
be split in more fine grained subworks.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Judge on all these works is the donor and donor decides if a phase is
called succesfull done and money can be paid.
