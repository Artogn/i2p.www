<p>23:59 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Oops!
<p>23:59 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I was just about to try that, mids! :)
<p>23:59 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I think I figured it out!
<p>23:59 &lt;@mids&gt; you did
<p>23:59  * hezekiah feals very happy with himself for learning more about IRC. :)
<p>--- Day changed Wed Feb 05 2003
<p>00:00 &lt; MrEcho&gt; lol
<p>00:00 &lt;@mids&gt; Tue Feb  4 23:00:10 UTC 2003
<p>00:00 &lt;@mids&gt; Welcome to the 29th iip meeting
<p>00:00 &lt;@mids&gt; nop emailed me that he wont be there
<p>00:00 &lt;@mids&gt; so you got to do it without him
<p>00:00 &lt;@mids&gt; I dont have a specific agenda
<p>00:00 &lt;@mids&gt; except for this
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; 1) welcome :)
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; 2) highlights of the week
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; 3) questions
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>00:01 &lt;@mids&gt; any highlights to report?
<p>00:02 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Uh, not on my side. I'm still waiting for UserX or nop to look at the GnuMP BigNum impl. to see if it's OK.
<p>00:02 &lt;@mids&gt; userx added some code to the isproxy so that an empty node.ref file wont do harm if you upload
<p>00:02 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; The configure options for it got uploaded though.
<p>00:02 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Is IIP 1.1 out yet?
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; havent seen it
<p>00:03 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I guess not.
<p>00:03 &lt;@mids&gt; only thing is that we need to look at the location where the files are saved
<p>00:04 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Hmmm ...
<p>00:04 &lt;@mids&gt; and if that gives bugs on different operating systems
<p>00:04 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; What exactly is the problem?
<p>00:05  * mids loads the sourceforge bugtracker
<p>00:05 &lt;@mids&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=651711&group_id=50945&atid=461514
<p>00:05  * hezekiah is doing the same.
<p>00:05 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Thanks. :)
<p>00:06 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I remeber looking at that briefly once.
<p>00:07 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; The tricky part is what you are supposed to do in Windows.
<p>00:07 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; The *nix/*BSD part shouldn't be that difficult. (I hope.)
<p>00:07 &lt;@mids&gt; in windows it does just look at the current working directory
<p>00:08 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I'll leave the Windows part to UserX. :)
<p>00:08 &lt;@mids&gt; the windows behavious shouldnt change imho
<p>00:09 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Whatever. I run linux, and avoid Windows whenever I can. ;-)
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; same
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; but what behaviour do we want for unix?
<p>00:09 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; The behavior is defined in the code using #ifdef's based on platform.
<p>00:09 &lt;@mids&gt; you need to have access to the root/iip account to be able to access ~iip/.iip
<p>00:10 &lt;@mids&gt; so it should also look in other dirs
<p>00:10 &lt;@mids&gt; like ~/.iip
<p>00:10 &lt;@mids&gt; or the current dir
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, if isproxy is installed the default thing for a program to do would be look in /home/&lt;user's homedir name&gt;/.iip
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; So in my case: /home/hezekiah/.iip
<p>00:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; node.ref would be /home/hezekiah/.iip/node.ref
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Then each user can have their own settings, etc.
<p>00:11 &lt; MrEcho&gt; you can kind of do the same thing in NT
<p>00:11 &lt; MrEcho&gt; my doc's folder is protected
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; But under Win9[58] there really aren
<p>00:11 &lt; MrEcho&gt; ya
<p>00:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; aren't user specific home dirs.
<p>00:12 &lt; MrEcho&gt; anyone using 9x needs help anyways ....
<p>00:12  * hezekiah laughs
<p>00:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, I'll email nop and ask him how he wants it done for *nix. Then, I'll see what I can do.
<p>00:12 &lt;@mids&gt; mail the list please
<p>00:13 &lt;@mids&gt; the we can all discuss
<p>00:13 &lt; MrEcho&gt; for the 9x ppl just put the files in ./.iip/
<p>00:13 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; OK.
<p>00:13 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Or when IIP is installed it could be installed in Program Files/IIP.
<p>00:14 &lt; MrEcho&gt; for 9x ppl
<p>00:14 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; node.ref, isproxy.ini, seed.rnd, etc. could be placed there.
<p>00:14 &lt;@mids&gt; if you start IIP with a windows start thingie, then you can set the workingdirectory
<p>00:15 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, anyway, I don't intend to touch the Windows implementation with a ten-foot poll. UserX can figure this one out. ;-)
<p>00:15 &lt; MrEcho&gt; :P
<p>00:15 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:15 &lt; FillaMent&gt; You could look into a nasty WSH script. Then you can store in info in the registry
<p>00:15 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (My compiler might not even _compile_ IIP under Windows!)
<p>00:15 &lt;@mids&gt; :)
<p>00:15 &lt; MrEcho&gt; fuck the registry
<p>00:15 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; FillaMent: if we used the registry in a program that needs to work under *nix, it would be an #ifdef NIGHTMARE!!
<p>00:16 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Not what I"m saying
<p>00:16 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (But I will admit I tought of it to for a few seconds ... only a few, mind you.)
<p>00:16 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Oh?
<p>00:16 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Explain? :)
<p>00:17 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Have the location of the data file stored in the registry, then launch IIP with a WSH script that pulls the path out of the registry and pass it to the program as a cmnd line option
<p>00:17 &lt; MrEcho&gt; http://bofh.st/bofh/images/traffic.gif
<p>00:18 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; That might be doable.
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; I only had someone asking for windows NOT to change the current system there
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; maybe it would be nice to let it work without registry
<p>00:19 &lt; FillaMent&gt; A while back I wrote a script that would replace the name of the last logged in user with an arbitrary string. NT Ninja Vanish =) Had to do it because Generals and Colonels would freak because there was another login nam
<p>00:19 &lt;@mids&gt; from a security / anonymity pov
<p>00:20 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I have to admit that I hate the Windoze registry with a pasion, just my personal opinion, though. :)
<p>00:20 &lt; MrEcho&gt; same here hezekiah
<p>00:20 &lt; MrEcho&gt; but ive learned to work with it
<p>00:20 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; So have I, ... but I still hate it. :)
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; so
<p>00:20 &lt;@mids&gt; lets investigate this week how the system currently works
<p>00:21 &lt;@mids&gt; and discuss on the list about how it should
<p>00:21 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Right.
<p>00:21 &lt;@mids&gt; after that, make it work like it should :)
<p>00:21 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I'll post an email to start up the conversation.
<p>00:21 &lt;@mids&gt; yay
<p>00:21 &lt;@mids&gt;  so
<p>00:21 &lt;@mids&gt; next item?
<p>00:22 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; 3.) questions
<p>00:22 &lt; MrEcho&gt; where the hell is 1.1  
<p>00:22 &lt;@mids&gt; *nod*
<p>00:22 &lt; MrEcho&gt; hehe
<p>00:22 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I don't know.
<p>00:22 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; But I think the reason it's not out is because of the aforementioned bug.
<p>00:22 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (The one we are going to talk about on the mailing list.)
<p>00:23 &lt; MrEcho&gt; i just hope it connects faster and more stable connections
<p>00:24 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (I have to admit I haven't had a problem with unstable connections, and I usually connect to the 1st or 2nd node I try.)
<p>00:24 &lt;@mids&gt; but that is just because you have a clean node.ref, I assume?
<p>00:24 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; No.
<p>00:24 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I have a normal node.ref
<p>00:24 &lt;@mids&gt; oh
<p>00:25 &lt;@mids&gt; but you never stay online for 24 h
<p>00:25 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; It's the one the server gives me each time I conect.
<p>00:25 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I can stay connected for a couple days, usually.
<p>00:25 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; No. I have a life. ;-)
<p>00:25 &lt;@mids&gt; one can stay online without irc-ing ofcourse
<p>00:25 &lt;@mids&gt; *geeh*
<p>00:25 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; And my family's phone line is the same on the internet connection is on. :)
<p>00:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; eww
<p>00:26 &lt;@mids&gt; then get offline now!
<p>00:26 &lt;@mids&gt; :)
<p>00:26 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Other questions?
<p>00:26 &lt;@mids&gt; I dont have those
<p>00:28 &lt; FillaMent&gt; HaZaa...
<p>00:28 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; HaZaa?
<p>00:28 &lt;@mids&gt; gesundheit
<p>00:28 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; *lol*
<p>00:28 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Was that a question, FillaMent?
<p>00:28 &lt; FillaMent&gt; My FServe
<p>00:29 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; OK. I'm lost. :)
<p>00:29 &lt;@mids&gt; tell us about it hezekiah 
<p>00:29 &lt;@mids&gt; s/hezekiah/FillaMent/
<p>00:30 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I was just wondering if there'd be any expected problems using IIP as a comm backbone for a lot of file browsing.
<p>00:30 &lt; FillaMent&gt; And eventually a text-based protocol like HTTP
<p>00:30 &lt;@mids&gt; you will be bound to the slowness of IIP
<p>00:30 &lt;@mids&gt; the 50B/s limit 
<p>00:31 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; IIP might not always be slow, mids. ;-)
<p>00:31 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; We shall optimize and improve. :)
<p>00:31 &lt;@mids&gt; hurray
<p>00:31 &lt; FillaMent&gt; That's not a big deal since we're not doing actual file transfer of IIP. Just comm. I'm concerned with whether or not it would be a strain.
<p>00:32 &lt; lonelynerd&gt; 50B/s might be ok for telnet
<p>00:32 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; (Mids? You want to answer all this? I'm reeaaallllyyy lost.)
<p>00:32 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>00:32 &lt;@mids&gt; FillaMent is working on something caled HaZaa
<p>00:32 &lt;@mids&gt; it is some fserve on IIP
<p>00:33 &lt;@mids&gt; which uses Freenet for the actual file sharing
<p>00:33 &lt;@mids&gt; right?
<p>00:33 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Yeah... IIP for the browsing.
<p>00:33 &lt;@mids&gt; so you have some telnet/ftp like interface locally
<p>00:33 &lt; FillaMent&gt; firing it up now.
<p>00:34 &lt; FillaMent&gt; haz: /msg hazaaclone shell
<p>00:36 &lt; FillaMent&gt; haz: /msg hazaaclone cd /stuff/mp3s
<p>00:38 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Not bad!!
<p>00:38 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Uh ... how do you leave the shell?
<p>00:38 &lt; FillaMent&gt; It just times out.
<p>00:38 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Oh ...
<p>00:39 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Think traffic like that would be a problem... I expect /lots/ of people will run them. Especially since DALnet just put a ban on FServes
<p>00:40 &lt; HazaaClone&gt; I might clog your chat network =) 
<p>00:40 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Hmmm ...
<p>00:40 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; That would be a problem. :)
<p>00:41 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Dunno how much traffic it would be or what effect it will have on IIP.
<p>00:41 &lt;@mids&gt; during the slashdot attack we did do pretty well
<p>00:41 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Sounds solid then.
<p>00:41 &lt;@mids&gt; the total amount of people wasnt too high
<p>00:41 &lt;@mids&gt; but it was constant joining and parting
<p>00:42 &lt; FillaMent&gt; I /think/ I got the flooding issue fixed.
<p>00:43 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, if you threw in an "exit/quit" command, maybe the connections would be lower. Just a suggestion. :)
<p>00:44 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, I had better go. See you all around. :)
<p>00:44 &lt; FillaMent&gt; THe eventual version will use IIP to pass search queries and query results.
<p>00:45 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; mids: I'm looking into the code on the file placement bug. I should have an email up on the mailing list shortly. :)
<p>00:45 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Bye, all! :)
<p>00:45 &lt;@mids&gt; bye
<p>00:46 &lt; MrEcho&gt; hey mids .. have you checked out iip-im latly
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; nope
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; but I didnt get many CVS updates
<p>00:46 &lt; MrEcho&gt; got a bunch of stuff done
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; lets end the official part of the meeting
<p>00:46 &lt; MrEcho&gt; im working on xml themes right  now
<p>00:46 &lt;@mids&gt; and move over to friendly chit chat
<p>00:46 &lt; MrEcho&gt; ...
<p>00:47 &lt; FillaMent&gt; ooooo! That just gave me an idea.
<p>00:48 &lt; FillaMent&gt; Oooo.... this is going to ROCK!
<p>00:48 &lt;@mids&gt; ?
