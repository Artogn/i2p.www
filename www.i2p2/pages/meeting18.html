<p>23:57 &lt; nop&gt; hi hezekiah 
<p>--- Day changed Wed Nov 06 2002
<p>00:00 &lt; Neo&gt; 23:00:00.00 UTC
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; welcome
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; I kind of want to wait, looks like a relay died
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; just another minute
<p>00:00 &lt; nop&gt; so that people can re-assimilate ;)
<p>00:01 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Yeah. I got bumped out about 30 seconds ago.
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; right
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:01 &lt; nop&gt; welcome to the n-th iip-dev meeting
<p>00:02 &lt; hezekiah&gt; 18th!
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; I think it's like the 18th
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; yes
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; thnx
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; on the agenda
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; 1) welcome &lt;-- we're doing this now
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; 2) agenda list &lt;-- we're doing this now
<p>00:02 &lt; nop&gt; 3) ;)
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; 4) IIP logo
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; 5) Dev report
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; 6) RC3 (coming soon, we promise)
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; 7) questions
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; .
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; ok we did the welcome and the agenda
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; let's do the ;)
<p>00:03 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; Ok IIP logo
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; and slogan
<p>00:04 &lt; co&gt; Where can we see the logos that have been submitted?
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; none have really been submitted
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; except one
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; and I submitted a slogan for InvisibleNet
<p>00:04 &lt; nop&gt; I'll tell you mine
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; front part of shirt "You can't attack what you can't see..."
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; then back would say
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; InvisibleNet 
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; then there's this other one, I'll mail to iip-dev 
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; but no one else seems to care
<p>00:05 &lt; nop&gt; so... :(
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; then again
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; no one seems to want to buy shirts for IIP anyway
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; so... what can ya do
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; yes we're working on getting black shirts
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; next on the agenda
<p>00:06 &lt; nop&gt; Dev report
<p>00:07 &lt; nop&gt; same ol' same ol' dev is working on the core control
<p>00:08 &lt; nop&gt; userx will give a brief summary
<p>00:08 &lt; hezekiah&gt; *applause*
<p>00:09 &lt; UserX&gt; core control will provide a system for being able to support multiple cores in iip. each core is esssentially network protocol
<p>00:10 &lt; UserX&gt; .
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; ok
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; thank you UserX
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; man of many words
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; ;)
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; or woman
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; never know
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; anyway
<p>00:10 &lt; nop&gt; RC3 
<p>00:11 &lt; nop&gt; it's on it's way out the door, I believe there is an openbsd compatibility that was reported and from what I know, it's been patched and cvs'd
<p>00:11 &lt; nop&gt; (for some reason, I haven't got a listserv about it)
<p>00:11 &lt; nop&gt; but we're hoping that this weekend would be a good time to do an RC3 upgrade
<p>00:11 &lt; nop&gt; and it's not going to conflict with rc2 in any way 
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; just mostly bug fixes
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; Questions
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; anyone?
<p>00:12 &lt; codeshark&gt; so everything is in cvs now?
<p>00:12 &lt; dj28&gt; yea
<p>00:12 &lt; dj28&gt; i have a stupid one
<p>00:12 &lt; dj28&gt; when will the IIP core server migrate away from the irc protocol?
<p>00:12 &lt; nop&gt; codeshark - I believe so, please check with UserX to make sure he's comfortable with it
<p>00:13 &lt; nop&gt; this is what the core control dev work puts us in a position to do
<p>00:13 &lt; dj28&gt; and when will it become completely distributed?
<p>00:13 &lt; dj28&gt; oh ok
<p>00:13 &lt; nop&gt; so then we'll be able to build upon that
<p>00:13 &lt; UserX&gt; codeshark: it will be once my server is talking to the internet again
<p>00:13 &lt; nop&gt; and we hope to have 1.2 a fully distributed version
<p>00:13 &lt; dj28&gt; ok. cool
<p>00:13 &lt; nop&gt; at least at communication level
<p>00:13 &lt; nop&gt; the routing might still be run through inform
<p>00:14 &lt; nop&gt; but the communication should be decentralized
<p>00:14 &lt; nop&gt; similar to how freenet 0.3 was
<p>00:14 &lt; dj28&gt; yea
<p>00:14 &lt; nop&gt; any other questions?
<p>00:15 &lt; co&gt; So a core is a package of encryption algorithms that allow network communication?
<p>00:15 &lt; co&gt; Explain that concept again, please.
<p>00:15 &lt; Mak&gt; wow ...i jumped here ...sorry ...
<p>00:16 &lt; nop&gt; well
<p>00:16 &lt; nop&gt; a core is a network protocol
<p>00:16 &lt; nop&gt; this puts us in a modular position
<p>00:16 &lt; nop&gt; to possibly support many routing architectures
<p>00:16 &lt; Neo&gt; oooh nice...
<p>00:17 &lt; nop&gt; this could position us to support many protocols
<p>00:18 &lt; nop&gt; the core control is similar to an API for cores
<p>00:19 &lt; nop&gt; any more questions?
<p>00:19 &lt; co&gt; Thank you.
<p>00:19 &lt; nop&gt; np
<p>00:21 &lt; nop&gt; oh
<p>00:21 &lt; nop&gt; one more thing
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; Many thanks to Phiberoptika for her fine translation of the El Pais newspaper article done on IIP
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; it appears in spanish and with english translation (done by Phiberoptika) on the iip site www.invisiblenet.net/iip
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; it's a good article
<p>00:22 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Cool! I'll have to check that out! Thanks, Phiberoptika! :)
<p>00:22 &lt; al-jabr&gt; I have a question...
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; yes sir
<p>00:22 &lt; al-jabr&gt; Two questions
<p>00:22 &lt; nop&gt; sure
<p>00:22 &lt; al-jabr&gt; I had one problem
<p>00:23 &lt; al-jabr&gt; running IIP in linux, don't know if it's actually an IIP problem
<p>00:23 &lt; al-jabr&gt; after I killed isproxy
<p>00:23 &lt; al-jabr&gt; and tried to run again, it couldn't bind to the port
<p>00:23 &lt; al-jabr&gt; had this problem a couple times, had to change the port number
<p>00:23 &lt; al-jabr&gt; but when i logged of and on again (a few days later) the port was available
<p>00:24 &lt; al-jabr&gt; so I'm not sure that's directly an issue with isproxy
<p>00:24 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Is this reproducable, or just a random happening?
<p>00:24 &lt; nop&gt; right, if you wait like 1 minute with RC2 you can rebind 
<p>00:24 &lt; UserX&gt; was something connected to it when you killed it?
<p>00:24 &lt; al-jabr&gt; i'll try to reproduce it
<p>00:24 &lt; al-jabr&gt; but
<p>00:24 &lt; al-jabr&gt; no, nothing was connected to 6667
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; oh that port
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; hmm
<p>00:25 &lt; al-jabr&gt; and it happened like three or four times and i had to keep changing ports
<p>00:25 &lt; al-jabr&gt; yeah
<p>00:25 &lt; al-jabr&gt; not the other one
<p>00:25 &lt; Phiberoptika&gt; re:article: ;)!!!, no problem chicos..
<p>00:25 &lt; al-jabr&gt; i haven't reproduced it since then, but i haven't been trying
<p>00:25 &lt; nop&gt; hehe
<p>00:25 &lt; al-jabr&gt; since i rarely go restarted isproxy
<p>00:26 &lt; al-jabr&gt; i should probably try to.  also, i was experiencing a lot of problems with the network for the last few days
<p>00:26 &lt; Povert&gt; I have a question....
<p>00:26 &lt; al-jabr&gt; and i don't know if it's something local
<p>00:26 &lt; UserX&gt; odd. the only reason i know for that to happen is that if the connection is closed properly it will be left hanging and you have to wait for the OS to time it out
<p>00:26 &lt; Povert&gt; is de openbsd thing realy solved?
<p>00:26 &lt; al-jabr&gt; or if it's not really any worse than it's usually been
<p>00:27 &lt; al-jabr&gt; because, before the last couple days, i got kicked off, maybe a couple times a day at MOST, then all of the sudden i was getting kicked off every few minutes, and sometimes not getting on at all, and sometimes lagging
<p>00:27 &lt; UserX&gt; al-jabr: did you try using netstat to see if there were any lingering connections to port 6667
<p>00:27 &lt; al-jabr&gt; and changing node.refs didn't seem to help
<p>00:27 &lt; al-jabr&gt; no, i should have investigated that
<p>00:27 &lt; al-jabr&gt; silly me
<p>00:27 &lt; al-jabr&gt; i'll try it a bit more and i'll do that
<p>00:28 &lt; al-jabr&gt; i didn't think that there could be connections on the other end after the server is killed
<p>00:28 &lt; nop&gt; would netstat give a TIME_WAIT?
<p>00:29 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Also, sometimes a process of isproxy hangs (but that only has happened to me when I'm debugging buggy code.) You should be able to check to see if there are still a hanging process of isproxy by doing: ps -e | grep isproxy
<p>00:29 &lt; al-jabr&gt; i did that
<p>00:29 &lt; al-jabr&gt; no isproxies were running
<p>00:29 &lt; hezekiah&gt; Good. :)
<p>00:30 &lt; al-jabr&gt; no, bad.
<p>00:30 &lt; al-jabr&gt; but anyway, i'll investigate that some more, probably not a big issue
<p>00:32 &lt; Povert&gt; nop
<p>00:32 &lt; Povert&gt; is openbsd kompilation ready solved?
<p>00:32 &lt; Neo&gt; diff -r1.2 sock.h
<p>00:32 &lt; Neo&gt; 45c45
<p>00:32 &lt; Neo&gt; &lt; #elif defined(__FreeBSD__) || defined(__MACH__)
<p>00:32 &lt; Neo&gt; ---
<p>00:32 &lt; Neo&gt; &gt; #elif defined(__FreeBSD__) || defined(__MACH__) || defined(__OpenBSD__)
<p>00:33 &lt; Povert&gt; in codetree I meen
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; it's about to be committed
<p>00:34 &lt; Povert&gt; ok
<p>00:34 &lt; Povert&gt; dank
<p>00:34 &lt; nop&gt; yep
<p>00:37 &lt; nop&gt; any more questions?
<p>00:42 &lt; nop&gt; thanks for attending
<p>00:42 &lt; nop&gt; .
