<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; Welcome to the 10th IIP meeting
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; Agenda:
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; 1) Welcome
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; 2) Website status update
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; 3) ...
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; a) Questions
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; lets go to point 1
<p>01:00 &lt;@mids&gt; welcome all
<p>01:00 &lt; legabier&gt; why freenet is so slow and iip so fast?
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; legabier: can we keep that till part a ?
<p>01:01 &lt; legabier&gt; ok
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; part 2
<p>01:01 &lt;@mids&gt; nop: status update?
<p>01:02 &lt;@mids&gt; hm
<p>01:02 &lt;@mids&gt; the website is in CVS
<p>01:02 &lt;@mids&gt; nop has reviewed the files
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; but there are some parts without good text
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; and the support area needs a better layout
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; appart from that it is done
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; I wont tell you when the site is up
<p>01:03 &lt;@mids&gt; but you are free to do private bettings on the online time :)
<p>01:04 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>01:04 &lt;@mids&gt; nop probably has something to add
<p>01:04 &lt;@mids&gt; lets wait 3 min or something
<p>01:06 &lt; athena&gt; lol
<p>01:06 &lt;@mids&gt; I guess nop is too busy with editing the website to answer
<p>01:06 &lt;@mids&gt; okay well...
<p>01:06 &lt;@mids&gt; before we go to the question round.. any other items we should discuss?
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; guess not :-)
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; I like it when everybody agrees :)
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; question from legabier: "why freenet is so slow and iip so fast?"
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; freenet is a different program, there is no technical relationship between IIP and Freenet
<p>01:08 &lt;@mids&gt; Freenet is completely decentralized.. IIP isn't (yet)
<p>01:08 &lt;@nop&gt; haha
<p>01:09 &lt;@mids&gt; Freenet is intended for file transfer, while IRC over IIP uses short lines
<p>01:09 &lt;@nop&gt; just because freenet is decentralized
<p>01:09 &lt;@nop&gt; is not the reason why IIP is fast
<p>01:09 &lt;@mids&gt; well, enlighten us, o master yoda :)
<p>01:10 &lt;@nop&gt; differences
<p>01:10 &lt;@nop&gt; freenet == high volume, low speed, static (archived) content
<p>01:10 &lt;@nop&gt; iip == low volume, high speed, dynamic content
<p>01:10 &lt;@nop&gt; different concepts all together, centralized or decentralized, IIP will remain fast
<p>01:11  * mids hopes that too
<p>01:11  * nop knows that
<p>01:11 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>01:11 &lt;@mids&gt; does that answer your question legabier ? 
<p>01:12 &lt; legabier&gt; yes merci :)
<p>01:13  * mids aims the spotlight in the audience.. searching for the next question and/or comment
<p>01:13 &lt; athena&gt; why are there so few public relays (besides the ones nop runs and mids', i see only 2 or 3 others usually)?  do we have no volunteers or does the uptime checker reject a lot of them?
<p>01:13 &lt; Sheige&gt; I got 8 of them.... I guess
<p>01:14 &lt; Sheige&gt; (still a few)
<p>01:14 &lt; athena&gt; how many is that if you don't count mids' and nop's?
<p>01:14 &lt;@mids&gt; 5
<p>01:14 &lt;@mids&gt; source: http://invisiblenet.net/iip/crypto/node.ref
<p>01:15 &lt; athena&gt; hmmm, ok... guess i need to pull down a new one... still, 20 or so public nodes would be nice :)
<p>01:15 &lt;@mids&gt; I _think_ that the uptime checker is a bit too strict
<p>01:16 &lt;@mids&gt; codeshark had to pause it some time ago when the net was down
<p>01:16 &lt;@mids&gt; otherwise it would kick all relays out
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; the strict checking is a good thing
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; you'd have more problems if you had a lot of relays not working
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; it's better to have lower number with solid relay connection
<p>01:17 &lt;@mids&gt; nop: well.. but the reannounces dont seem to work
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; than a bunch of crappy ones
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; yes they do
<p>01:17 &lt;@mids&gt; hm
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; it just takes time
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; plus if you're a relay you won't see your route
<p>01:17 &lt;@mids&gt; then why do we only have 7 :)
<p>01:17 &lt;@nop&gt; because the stability of the relays
<p>01:18 &lt;@nop&gt; it may take a few more days for them to show up
<p>01:20 &lt;@nop&gt; talk to codeshark about this
<p>01:20 &lt;@nop&gt; he would have more detail
<p>01:20 &lt;@nop&gt; I will test it with him
<p>01:20 &lt;@mids&gt; ok
<p>01:21 &lt;@mids&gt; I think that I have somehow too many nodes connecting to my relay
<p>01:21 &lt;@mids&gt; but maybe there are a lot more users then we know about :)
<p>01:21 &lt; athena&gt; how many connections do you have?
<p>01:22 &lt;@mids&gt; I dont know if I should tell that
<p>01:22  * mids does some back channel talking
<p>01:22 &lt; athena&gt; could be that you're the best reachable relay
<p>01:22 &lt;@mids&gt; heh, I wouldnt say that with the recent lack of stability
<p>01:22 &lt; athena&gt; i often find that i can't connect through half of the hosts in node.ref
<p>01:23 &lt; athena&gt; and when you start with 7 that's not a whole lot of reliable relays
<p>01:23 &lt;@nop&gt; well, most usually are that are on
<p>01:23 &lt; athena&gt; just relating my experience...
<p>01:24 &lt;@nop&gt; maybe it's recent
<p>01:25 &lt;@mids&gt; it would be interesting to measure uptime...
<p>01:25 &lt;@mids&gt; but...
<p>01:25 &lt; athena&gt; you'd have to measure it from topologically diverse sites
<p>01:27 &lt;@mids&gt; nop: would you be against that?
<p>01:27 &lt;@mids&gt; if this whole thing wasn't about anonymity, I would love to see a lot of statistics :)
<p>01:27 &lt;@nop&gt; umm, if it exposes attacking info, yes
<p>01:28 &lt;@nop&gt; maybe we'll set up a non-anonymous weary system later and take stats
<p>01:28 &lt; athena&gt; i would say any publicly available stats SHOULD be published
<p>01:28 &lt;@nop&gt; especially as it gets bigger
<p>01:28 &lt; athena&gt; rely on the security of IIP, not on keeping info secret
<p>01:28 &lt;@nop&gt; well athena, if anyone was taking stats, they should be published
<p>01:28 &lt;@nop&gt; but no one is so far
<p>01:28 &lt;@nop&gt; anyone who is please publish your findings
<p>01:28 &lt;@nop&gt; ;)
<p>01:29 &lt; athena&gt; maybe i will :p
<p>01:29 &lt;@mids&gt; well.. I'll try to collect stats in a 'fair' way
<p>01:29 &lt;@mids&gt; without abusing my public node-powers
<p>01:29 &lt;@mids&gt; what I can collect that way, everybody can
<p>01:29 &lt; athena&gt; that's exactly what i meant, great
<p>01:30 &lt; ArdVark&gt; why not abuse your public node power and show us what that entails too mids?
<p>01:30 &lt;@mids&gt; now if I disappear from the IIP chat system... it is because someone doesnt like me collecting the stats ;)
<p>01:30 &lt;@mids&gt; ArdVark: maybe that is the next step...
<p>01:30 &lt; athena&gt; ArdVark: lol, excellent point!  since anyway can become a public node...
<p>01:31 &lt; athena&gt; s/anyway/anyone/
<p>01:31 &lt;@mids&gt; athena: install a public relay and you do it :)
<p>01:31 &lt; ArdVark&gt; I wanna see the failures as well as the successes of this beast reported
<p>01:32 &lt;@mids&gt; would be cool to have 100 'agencies' all running a public relay to log connections, but in the meanwhile helping to boost the anonymity
<p>01:33 &lt; ArdVark&gt; on a different topic, not to end the current one, has there ever been any thought to adding wiki to invisiblnet?  or too much trouble?
<p>01:33 &lt;@mids&gt; wiki as in wikiwiki?
<p>01:33 &lt; ArdVark&gt; yes
<p>01:33 &lt;@mids&gt; those $#@&%@ infobots are already some wiki
<p>01:33 &lt; athena&gt; mids: how do you know i don't already run a public relay ;)
<p>01:34 &lt; ArdVark&gt; I love those infobots mids   ;)
<p>01:34 &lt;@mids&gt; ArdVark: I know you do
<p>01:34 &lt;@mids&gt; ArdVark: if you put a webserver 'behind' IIP.. then you could install a wiki on it
<p>01:35 &lt; ArdVark&gt; ok, that is reasonable I guess
<p>01:35 &lt;@mids&gt; but running a webserver over irc isnt too great
<p>01:35 &lt; ArdVark&gt; no I meant the website
<p>01:35 &lt;@mids&gt; oh
<p>01:35 &lt;@mids&gt; you mean on the normal website
<p>01:35 &lt; ArdVark&gt; yes
<p>01:36 &lt;@mids&gt; guess you could do that
<p>01:36 &lt;@mids&gt; otoh.. you could use a public wiki too....
<p>01:36 &lt; ArdVark&gt; ok
<p>01:37 &lt;@mids&gt; I think we shouldnt really install the wiki on sourceforge.... not now
<p>01:37 &lt;@mids&gt; since it is some work to install/tweak etc
<p>01:38 &lt;@mids&gt; but someone could run a wiki, and then IIP could point to it
<p>01:38 &lt; ArdVark&gt; fine
<p>01:39 &lt;@mids&gt; ArdVark: but maybe a public wiki for IIP (like freenet has now) is the way to go
<p>01:39 &lt;@mids&gt; .
<p>01:39 &lt; ArdVark&gt; yeah ok  
<p>01:41 &lt;@mids&gt; I am going to sleep. feel free to keep chatting here :)
<p>01:41 &lt; athena&gt; night mids
<p>01:49 &lt;@mids&gt; for those who want to play with a wiki: http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/phpwiki/
<p>01:49 &lt;@mids&gt; I dont care what you do with it :)
