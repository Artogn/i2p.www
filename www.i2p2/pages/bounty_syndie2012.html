<p>Beside of I2P we want to encourage users
to care more about anonymity and security. As I2P is a low 
latency network with its natural limits, the software SYNDIE
can overcome some of these limits and provide better anonymity
for people who really need it. </p>
<p>
For our bad sake the syndie project was out of development for 
quite a long time yet (5 years). 
</p>
<p>
The latest syndie coding rallye did improve the situation of the
syndie package dramatically. A new syndie package with bugfixes
was created and made available on different webpages.
As of this work been done, the bounty sum was reduced and
the withdrawn money moved to the IPv6 bounty.
</p>
<p>
Still a few jobs are left to be done, e.g. (taken from Lillith syndie post
 urn:syndie:channel:d7:channel44:FRkKGjUxBPXAIG~j6uc4S7cEeQ6Eb0y44wEeuWxREYU=9:messageIdi1364502130641ee ):<br>
1. Port Syndie to AWT or another platform agnostic toolkit <br>
2. Fix most, if not all GUI bugs (this relates to the first point somewhat) <br>
3. Port Syndie to HSQLDB 2.0 <br>
4. Be the maintainer for Syndie over a period of time (an amount per month or per quarter) and do the usual 
tasks like accepting and fixing minor bugs, promote Syndie in the wider world than just I2P, maintaining
 good documentation <br>
5. Add some sort of 'File Archive' as a transport (for sneakernets) <br>
6. Add more transports from the introduction image to Syndie: Usenet, Gnutella, E-Mail, iMule, Tahoe-LAFS <br>
7. Get syndie into repos for major distros (at least, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Gentoo, FreeBSD ports, PkgSrc) <br> 
8. Make the freenet archive work <br>
</p>
<p>
As these subtasks are of different difficulty and work, different amount of bounty are assigned to it:<br>
1. 5 BTC, 2. 2 BTC, 3. 2 BTC, 4. pure passion and appreciation by all the users, 5. 1 BTC, 6. 5 BTC, 7. 2 BTC and
finally 8. 1 BTC.<br>
Sum: 18 BTC<br> 
</p>
