<p>Beside of I2P we want to encourage users
to care more about anonymity and security. As I2P is a low 
latency network with its natural limits, the software SYNDIE
can overcome some of these limits and provide better anonymity
for people who really need it. </p>
<p>
For our bad sake the syndie project is out of development for 
quite a long time yet (5 years). To get a fresh and new built 
with needed bugfixes we set out this bounty. Also syndie needs
some enhancements and a better GUI for users to work with it.
Current bounty sum is 100 Bitcoin.
