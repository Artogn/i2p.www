<p>
The 0.8.13 release contains several bug fixes and a couple of new features.
We are pleased that the last release significantly improved performance,
and the network is running well despite continued rapid growth.
Upgrading is recommended.
</p>

<p>Files are available on the <a href="/download.html">download page.</a></p>


<p><strong>Release Details</strong></p>
<p>
This is likely to be the last release before 0.9, in which we will migrate to Jetty 6,
and introduce a simplified router console home page. Monitor the news section of
your the router console in the coming weeks for more information on the next release.
</p><p>
Starting with this release, the router will
check for and install plugin updates shortly upon restarting after a router update.
To prevent this, add the advanced configuration
<tt>plugins.autoUpdate=false</tt> before restarting.
There is also a new update-all button on the client configuration page.
</p><p>
Routers in certain countries will now automatically enable hidden mode for increased protection.
However, hidden mode may have lower performance or reliability, and is still a work in progress.
To disable hidden mode before restarting, add the advanced configuration
<tt>router.isHidden=false</tt>.
To disable hidden mode later, select <i>use all auto-detect methods</i> under <i>IP Configuration</i> on the
network configuration page.
For the list of countries see the thread on zzz.i2p.
The only country on the list that has more than one or two I2P users is China.
