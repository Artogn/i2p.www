<p>22:07 &lt; mids&gt; log is up http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/iip/meeting35/livelog.txt
<p>22:07 &lt; Aprogas&gt; /exec -o tail -f http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/iip/meeting35/livelog.txt
<p>22:08 &lt; Aprogas&gt; loops are fun
<p>22:08 &lt; mids&gt; unless anybody has any agenda;
<p>22:08 &lt; mids&gt; I'd like to hear what the official proposals are for the decentralized routing protocol
<p>22:09 &lt; Aprogas&gt; then at least have  1. decentral routing protocl 2. question  as agenda
<p>22:09 &lt; mids&gt; 1) welcome
<p>22:09 &lt; mids&gt; 2) decentralized protocol
<p>22:09 &lt; mids&gt; 3) WVTTK
<p>22:09 &lt; mids&gt; 4) questions
<p>22:09 &lt; Aprogas&gt; thats dutch
<p>22:10 &lt; mids&gt; whats the english word for it?
<p>22:10 &lt; Aprogas&gt; 3) WCTTA
<p>22:10 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe
<p>22:10 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but latin would be more elite
<p>22:10 &lt; Aprogas&gt; where is the director to tell me to shut up and get back to the point ?
<p>22:10 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Aprogas: be quite and get back to the point. ;-)
<p>22:10 &lt; mids&gt; quod etcetera mensa venit
<p>22:11 &lt; Aprogas&gt; hezekiah: thanks
<p>22:11 &lt; mids&gt; -1-
<p>22:11 &lt; mids&gt; Welcome everybody!
<p>22:11 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Hiya! :)
<p>22:11 &lt; mids&gt; as you see, the regular meetings are earlier as the other 33 ones from now on
<p>22:11 &lt; mihi&gt; hi mids
<p>22:11 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>22:11 &lt; mids&gt; -2-
<p>22:11 &lt; Aprogas&gt; to better fit the mainly US/EU users of IIP ?
<p>22:12 &lt; nop&gt; yo
<p>22:12 &lt; Aprogas&gt; hello nop
<p>22:12 -!- mode/#iip-dev [+o nop] by Trent
<p>22:12 &lt;@nop&gt; got the page
<p>22:12 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Hiya, nop! :)
<p>22:12 &lt; mids&gt; Aprogas: it would fit better for UserX / nop
<p>22:12 &lt;@nop&gt; is userx alive?
<p>22:12 &lt; Aprogas&gt; dont forget to change your nick to noP
<p>22:12 -!- nop is now known as noP
<p>22:12 &lt; mids&gt; 2) I'd like to hear what the official proposals are for the decentralized routing protocol
<p>22:12 &lt;@noP&gt; thnx aprogas
<p>22:12 &lt;@noP&gt; we have no official proposal till Friday 21:00 
<p>22:12 &lt; UserX&gt; noP: i'm here
<p>22:13 &lt;@noP&gt; that is to be discussed
<p>22:13 &lt;@noP&gt; there are semi-official proposals in www.invisiblenet.net/research
<p>22:13 &lt; Aprogas&gt; can i join that discussion to give totally useless suggestions ?
<p>22:13 &lt;@noP&gt; which are many different proposals
<p>22:13 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Uh, oh. Looks like I have a lot of reading to do before Friday. ;-)
<p>22:13 &lt;@noP&gt; we will log it
<p>22:13 &lt;@noP&gt; and you can suggest
<p>22:13 &lt;@noP&gt; during iip-dev meeting
<p>22:14 &lt;@noP&gt; yeah hezekiah we added more stuff ;)
<p>22:14 -!- mids changed the topic of #iip-dev to: IIP Meeting - logfiles: http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/iip/ - http://www.invisiblenet.net/research/
<p>22:14 &lt; mids&gt; ok
<p>22:14 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>22:14 &lt; mids&gt; quod etcetera mensa venit?
<p>22:14 &lt;@noP&gt; brb
<p>22:14 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; mids: What language is that?
<p>22:15 &lt; mids&gt; latin
<p>22:15 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Ah.
<p>22:15 &lt; Aprogas&gt; mensam sounds more correct
<p>22:15 &lt; mids&gt; it should mean something like: what else comes to the table
<p>22:15 &lt; Aprogas&gt; and `etcetera' isnt
<p>22:15 &lt; mids&gt; et cetera
<p>22:15 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but that still doesnt make sense
<p>22:16 &lt; mihi&gt; quod ceterum ad mensam venit?
<p>22:16 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe
<p>22:16 &lt; Aprogas&gt; when will the IIP sourcecode be translated to latin using latin.h ?
<p>22:16 &lt; mihi&gt; igpay atinlay? ;-)
<p>22:16 &lt; Aprogas&gt; in other words, when will IIP development freeze to transfer those manhours to my latin.h project and complete it, only to then implement it in IIP ?
<p>22:17 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Never.
<p>22:17 &lt; mids&gt; quod autem ad mensam venit
<p>22:17 &lt; mids&gt; powered by http://www.latijnnederlands.nl/
<p>22:17 &lt; mids&gt; .
<p>22:17 &lt; Aprogas&gt; thats W Echter TTK
<p>22:17 &lt; mids&gt; any IIP questions?
<p>22:17 &lt; mids&gt; Aprogas: 2. verder, voorts, en dan (ter voortzetting of uitwerking v. iets voorafgaands).
<p>22:17 &lt; mihi&gt; "*but* what comes to the table"?
<p>22:17 &lt; Aprogas&gt; `what' does
<p>22:18 &lt; mids&gt; mihi: questions, proposals, comments
<p>22:18 &lt; mihi&gt; mids, you missed the ""
<p>22:18 &lt; Aprogas&gt; anything that was talked about during the meeting but didnt fit in the point that was currently active
<p>22:18 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Is this item 3 on the agenda?
<p>22:18 &lt; Aprogas&gt; hezekiah: i think we are at questions yet
<p>22:18 &lt; mids&gt; hezekiah: yes
<p>22:18 &lt; Aprogas&gt; the meeting seems chaotic and without any real content, except that the decision on the routing protocol will be made later
<p>22:19 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; ... because I have no idea what "WVTTK" means and this conversation is definately obscure enough to be a possible candidate. ;-)
<p>22:19 &lt; mids&gt; ok, /me formalizes
<p>22:19 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Right
<p>22:19 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its probably because i am here
<p>22:19 &lt; mids&gt; and because I had a lot of beer
<p>22:19 &lt; Aprogas&gt; WVTTK in reality is anything that does not make sense
<p>22:19  * mids moves on to point 4
<p>22:20 &lt; mids&gt; any IIP related questions?
<p>22:20 &lt; Aprogas&gt; how does the IIP team expect the userbase to grow, and when will massive PR start to stimulate more growth ?
<p>22:20 &lt; Aprogas&gt; also, what kind of people does the IIP team expect to attract in the beginning, and with the PR campaign
<p>22:21 &lt; mids&gt; past experience has tought that it is very easy to get on slashdot
<p>22:21 &lt; mids&gt; which results in a quick increase of users
<p>22:21 &lt; mids&gt; but you need Cool Features
<p>22:21 &lt; mids&gt; to excuse an announcement
<p>22:21 &lt; Aprogas&gt; well, most slashdot users dont stay long i think
<p>22:21 &lt; Aprogas&gt; a few of them stay, but most just want to `check it out'
<p>22:21 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Right.
<p>22:21 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; So once we decentralize we will have something to brag about on /.
<p>22:22 &lt; mids&gt; then we can address some online magazines
<p>22:22 &lt; mids&gt; like theregister
<p>22:22 &lt; mids&gt; and/or wired
<p>22:22 &lt; Aprogas&gt; you need cool features to excuse an announcement, and you need a cool application to keep them
<p>22:22 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Right.
<p>22:22 &lt; Aprogas&gt; but slashdot is a pretty `limited' target group
<p>22:22 &lt; Aprogas&gt; it only attracts a certain type of people
<p>22:22 &lt; mids&gt; it is a part
<p>22:22 &lt; Aprogas&gt; perhaps some more diversity would be good
<p>22:22 &lt; mids&gt; you could also address some target audiences
<p>22:22 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I personally don't really care about attracting people. I just want a good program.
<p>22:23 &lt; mids&gt; like writing to the dutch organisation Martijn :)
<p>22:24 &lt; mids&gt; maybe some press release to AA groups, amnesty, EFF, scientology/cult critics
<p>22:24 &lt; mids&gt; hezekiah: even with a good program you require a certain userbase to be able to offer decent traffic
<p>22:25 &lt; mids&gt; you cant have only 2 users on your ultra-anonymous network
<p>22:25 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; The way I look at it, if it's easy enough to find on freashmeat/sourceforge and it offers what people want (good anonymized chat), then people will use it.
<p>22:26 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Yes. That is a very primitive outlook on userbase growth.
<p>22:26 &lt; Aprogas&gt; the average internet user does not search at sourceforge
<p>22:26 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its hard to search for something if you dont know that it exists
<p>22:26 &lt; mids&gt; hezekiah: freshmeat / sourceforge is only for the geeks
<p>22:26 &lt; mids&gt; they think that anonymity is 'cool' 
<p>22:26 &lt; mids&gt; but dont really need it that much
<p>22:26 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Or they have people they don't want to be looking over their shoulder. :)
<p>22:26 &lt; mids&gt; cause they have nothing to hide :)
<p>22:27 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; But their paranoia helps them set up secure nodes.
<p>22:27 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I'm not sure I would want my message traffic running through Great Aunt Edna's Windows Me machine.
<p>22:27 &lt; mids&gt; what is the target audience in your oppinion?
<p>22:27 &lt; mids&gt; 16-23 year old linux kiddies?
<p>22:27 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, I really don't care who uses it.
<p>22:28 &lt; mids&gt; or joe sixpack
<p>22:28 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I would just want the people who make the nodes to make them securely.
<p>22:28 &lt; Aprogas&gt; maybe some lawyers to defend us
<p>22:28 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Beyond that, I just want to make the program better by good coding.
<p>22:28 &lt; Aprogas&gt; if IIP is a proper program, it would take into account that not all nodes can be secure
<p>22:28 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Nop does some userbase kind of stuff. He seems to understand it pretty well.
<p>22:29 &lt; mids&gt; what do you mean?
<p>22:29 &lt; Aprogas&gt; hezekiah is the true programmer, he is afraid of users
<p>22:29 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Aprogas: IIP will do its best to be idiot proof, but the security of a system always comes down to the people who run it.
<p>22:29 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Aprogas: I'm not affraid of users. I just don't really care too much _who_ they are.
<p>22:29 &lt; mids&gt; http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html
<p>22:30 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; mids: He does corporate stuff. Buisness kind of things. I still don't know how he got funding to hire Cap'n Crunch.
<p>22:30 &lt; mids&gt; no comment
<p>22:30 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; lol
<p>22:33 &lt; mids&gt; I got nothing to say anymore
<p>22:33 &lt; mids&gt; other questions?
<p>22:33 &lt; Aprogas&gt; how many developers does IIP have right now, and how many hours per week do those developers spend (estimated)
<p>22:33 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Uh ..
<p>22:34 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; That's a trick question actually. :)
<p>22:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; is it ?
<p>22:34 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Which _kind_ of developers are you looking for?
<p>22:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i am not looking for developers
<p>22:34 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i just want to know how the IIP development is doing
<p>22:34 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; So you want to know about the developers who right isproxy?
<p>22:35 &lt; Aprogas&gt; IIP is more than just isproxy i guess
<p>22:35 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Yeah.
<p>22:35 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i just want to know how many people are currently spending time on IIP
<p>22:35 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; That's why it's a trick question. :)
<p>22:35 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Then I have no idea! :) Not all of them are probably public!
<p>22:35 &lt; mids&gt; how much time do you spend on IIP then?
<p>22:35 &lt; Aprogas&gt; never mind, ill just go watch the sf's actitivity meter i guess
<p>22:36 &lt; Aprogas&gt; if it has such information
<p>22:36 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; I can tell you that right now (to the best of my knowledge) there are really only two people actively writting code for the isproxy source.
<p>22:36 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; UserX and myself.
<p>22:36 &lt; mids&gt; *nod*
<p>22:36 &lt; Aprogas&gt; im not only talking about writing code
<p>22:36 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Nop is doing stuff in the background when he can that deals with neat protocols and theory.
<p>22:36 &lt; Aprogas&gt; also about plannig stuff, for example that routing protocol
<p>22:36 &lt; Aprogas&gt; just the project as a whole
<p>22:36 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; OK ... this is an opensource project. The "developers" are anyone who pitches in an idea.
<p>22:37 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; lol
<p>22:37 &lt; Aprogas&gt; actually i want to know how many manhours are spent (wasted?) on IIP, so i can calculate how much money that represents
<p>22:37 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; A lot trickier to answer than you thought, eh?
<p>22:37 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Well, I pretty much only know about work on isproxy.
<p>22:37 &lt; Aprogas&gt; ok
<p>22:37 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; That fluxuates based on how busy UserX and myself are.
<p>22:37 &lt;@noP&gt; aprogas you're being nit picky
<p>22:38 &lt; Aprogas&gt; its just that i want to know that if i were to donate money to this project, that i donate the right amount, not too much, not too little
<p>22:38 &lt;@noP&gt; if you're not on the dev team
<p>22:38 &lt;@noP&gt; then just don't waste your time
<p>22:38 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; For example, right now I am very busy in real life, so I haven't been able to touch the isproxy code for over a week! (Ack!)
<p>22:38 &lt; Aprogas&gt; so i want to know how much this project would `cost' in manhours
<p>22:39 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; On an average week where I can write code, I might get in 4-5 hours. That's a wild stab in the dark! UserX seems to code in spurts (no offense) having periouds where he doesn't have much time and then one week where there is a flurry of commits. (He might be coding the whole time and just committing when he has completed code. I really don't know.)
<p>22:39 &lt;@hezekiah&gt; Anyway, it's way to volatile for me to really get a handle on it.
<p>22:40 &lt; Aprogas&gt; ok
<p>22:41 &lt; Aprogas&gt; i have no more questions
<p>22:43  * mids ends the suffering
<p>22:43  * hezekiah hands mids the *baf*er
