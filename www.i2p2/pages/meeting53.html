<p>[21:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok.  21:00 UTC esta ahora</p>
<p>[21:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; welcome to the um meeting</p>
<p>[21:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we have a lot of people out today (nop, hezekiah, thecrypto, and userx), so we'll keep it brief</p>
<p>[21:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; agenda: 1) hi 2) sdk 3) status 4) questions</p>
<p>[21:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1) hi</p>
<p>[21:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hello.</p>
<p>[21:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 2) sdk</p>
<p>[21:11] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the I2P SDK 0.1 is ready for quiet release.  </p>
<p>[21:11] &lt;mihi&gt; quiet release?</p>
<p>[21:11] &lt;jrand0m&gt; basically we're not publicizing it except for people in the know, and those trusted by people in the know</p>
<p>[21:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; it is however fully ready to do application design, development, and testing with</p>
<p>[21:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; If you're on #iip-dev, you're in the know</p>
<p>[21:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so anyone who wants to check it out can either pull it from CVS or retrieve source, docs, and build from CHK@GZ-A-C~SH03AwBuKf~AE3E347IcKAwI,4K38eh3m06zAygRzUnw4tQ/i2p_sdk.zip</p>
<p>[21:13] * UserX has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>[21:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hey, its UserX</p>
<p>[21:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; The 0.1 of the SDK contains the working java client API, as well as both a python and java router implementation and a simple command line chat application</p>
<p>[21:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; The point of having the SDK is so that people can get a head start on development so their applications will be up and running once the network goes operational and public in september.</p>
<p>[21:16] &lt;mihi&gt; september that never ended? ;)</p>
<p>[21:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (rather than having the network up and running with no applications)</p>
<p>[21:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh</p>
<p>[21:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; no, we're actually beating the schedule I posted to iip-dev a few weeks back in the ganttproject document</p>
<p>[21:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; not by much (5 days), but beating it none the less.</p>
<p>[21:17] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'm quite confident that we'll be 1.0alpha in september.</p>
<p>[21:17] &lt;jrand0m&gt; Also, for status, I suspect that there will be a new I2NP (network proto) draft out by the end of the week.</p>
<p>[21:18] &lt;jrand0m&gt; Then, hopefully next week we can have some internal review and revisions, after which we can go into peer review.</p>
<p>[21:18] * shardy_ is now known as shardy</p>
<p>[21:18] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 'lo shardy</p>
<p>[21:18] &lt;shardy&gt; hiya.</p>
<p>[21:18] &lt;shardy&gt; how goes?</p>
<p>[21:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; wikked.  </p>
<p>[21:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I hear rumors we might be able to get some of your time for some .net client lib stuff?</p>
<p>[21:19] * jrand0m may be misinformed</p>
<p>[21:20] * ion has quit IRC (Ping timeout)</p>
<p>[21:21] &lt;shardy&gt; .net? nope, that's not me...</p>
<p>[21:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ah 'k, my bad</p>
<p>[21:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; soy muy tonto</p>
<p>[21:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; well, hi anyway :)</p>
<p>[21:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I also got some feedback from co wrt the naming service application</p>
<p>[21:22] * ion has joined #iip-dev</p>
<p>[21:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; "On August 8th the first version of the specification for the naming service was posted.  It was discovered that the specification has flaws, and I am revising it. It should be done within a week or so. After that, I will be start implementing the system.  In the end, there will be four components of this software: </p>
<p>[21:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1. Client program to interact with naming service.</p>
<p>[21:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 2. Program for the naming service itself.</p>
<p>[21:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 3. Administrative utilities for the naming service.</p>
<p>[21:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 4. A Certificate Authority (CA) component."</p>
<p>[21:23] &lt;jrand0m&gt; That's co's status report</p>
<p>[21:23] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I think that may be it for status, unless someone has something to add.</p>
<p>[21:24] &lt;shardy&gt; neat.</p>
<p>[21:24] &lt;jrand0m&gt; definitely neat</p>
<p>[21:24] &lt;shardy&gt; as soon as I get time I'm going to start looking over the specs and get familiar with the way you guys do things.</p>
<p>[21:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; cool.  the I2CP spec in the SDK is pretty much operational, but the I2P network spec posted yesterday is a few weeks behind the times.</p>
<p>[21:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'll be posting a new version probably on friday.</p>
<p>[21:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (and as this project only began in earnest maybe a month ago, we're open for variations in how we work)</p>
<p>[21:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh wait, now I remember, you're the ecc guy :)</p>
<p>[21:26] &lt;shardy&gt; yep, that's me. although I haven't really done much with ecc in a while... I'm now the prng guy.</p>
<p>[21:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh nice.  we're currently using generic prngs, and will want a better way to deal with random data</p>
<p>[21:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok</p>
<p>[21:27] &lt;shardy&gt; generic ones? nop mentioned using yarrow, which seems pretty good.</p>
<p>[21:28] &lt;shardy&gt; I'm doing implementation work on a new prng now. trying to reduce the theory and practice gap somewhat. :)</p>
<p>[21:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right.  we have a GPL'ed version of yarrow we can pull from freenet into the java implementations, but for the time being we're using java's built in one (java.security.SecureRandom)</p>
<p>[21:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh</p>
<p>[21:29] &lt;mihi&gt; be careful w/ yarrow from freenet, it does heisenbugs ;)</p>
<p>[21:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; lol</p>
<p>[21:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; well, thats fixed now that its synchronized</p>
<p>[21:29] * jrand0m opens the floor to any questions</p>
<p>[21:30] * mihi gets DNF for the key mentioned above :(</p>
<p>[21:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; shite.  I inserted it a dozen times at htl 25</p>
<p>[21:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'll reinsert it yet again</p>
<p>[21:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone have any questions, other than "why won't freenet find the SDK's key?"</p>
<p>[21:33] * mihi did not ask that ;) and does not have any other questions until he looks @ it ;)</p>
<p>[21:33] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh</p>
<p>[21:33] &lt;mihi&gt; who puts the log onto the wiki this time? /me has it completely this time.</p>
<p>[21:33] &lt;jrand0m&gt; awesome, go for it</p>
<p>[21:34] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I believe we're out of questions for the meeting, though please everyone feel free to post up further thoughts ot the mailing list.</p>
<p>[21:34] * jrand0m really likes active discussion on iip-dev, even if its everyone saying how my docs suck</p>
<p>[21:34] &lt;mihi&gt; your java sux, jrandom ;) (HHOK)</p>
<p>[21:35] &lt;jrand0m&gt; thats more like it</p>
<p>[21:35] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'm reinserting the .zip from freenet's CLI, so it'll probably have a different CHK</p>
<p>[21:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'll msg people with it after I reinsert it a few times</p>
<p>[21:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; mihi wants it.  anyone else I should msg?</p>
<p>[21:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (or anyone can ask at another time, as well)</p>
<p>[21:36] &lt;mihi&gt; you could mail it to me...</p>
<p>[21:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1.1Mb</p>
<p>[21:37] &lt;mihi&gt; if it is not *too* large.</p>
<p>[21:37] &lt;mihi&gt; erm, okay then not.</p>
<p>[21:37] * mihi is not kind on fetching splitfiles anyway</p>
<p>[21:37] &lt;mihi&gt; s/kind/keen/</p>
<p>[21:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh, are you going to suggest I insert it without FEC?</p>
<p>[21:38] &lt;mihi&gt; i guess it won't have any chance in current freenet.</p>
<p>[21:38] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, I'll see about getting it web accessible with a private URL</p>
<p>[21:39] * jrand0m feels kind of weird with this quiet release thing, but I think its for the best</p>
<p>[21:40] &lt;mihi&gt; just put it on some webspace and put some gpg conventional encryption around it - and tell the passphrase here.</p>
<p>[21:40] &lt;mihi&gt; or use the key mentioned above as passphrase</p>
<p>[21:40] &lt;mihi&gt; btw - shall i strip that one from the log?</p>
<p>[21:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; no need to.  I'm paranoid enough to believe if its said here, its available to those who want to see it ;)</p>
<p>[21:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'll have nop toss it up on some webspace when he gets back later this evening and anonymail people with the appropriate info (url &amp; password / technology / etc)</p>
<p>[21:43] &lt;mihi&gt; thx. "this evening" regarding which time zone? (me will go to bea in about 1 hour)</p>
<p>[21:43] &lt;mihi&gt; s/bea/bed</p>
<p>[21:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh, evening for nop, which is california</p>
<p>[21:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, I've got to jet.  </p>

<p>[21:47] * jrand0m *baf*s  mihi on the head</p>
<p>[21:47] * shardy has quit IRC (EOF From client)</p>
