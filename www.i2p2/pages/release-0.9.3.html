<p>
0.9.3 includes extensive low-level changes to the queueing of messages in the router.
We implement the CoDel Active Queue Management (AQM) algoorithm.
We also unify the queueing and priority mechanisms in the transports to aid diagnosis and reduce network latency.
Work continues on fixing UDP transport bugs and making UDP more resistant to attacks.
There are more changes to improve the performance of the router and reduce its memory usage.
Also, we enable i2psnark's DHT support, introduced last release, by default.
As usual, there's also lots of bug fixes in this release, so updating is recommended.
