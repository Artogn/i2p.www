{% block content %}

<p>0.9.9 fixes a number of bugs in the netdb, streaming, and i2ptunnel,
and starts work on a year-long plan to increase the strength
of the cryptographic signing algorithms used in the router, and support multiple algorithms
and key lengths simultaneously. Automatic update files will now be signed with 4096-bit RSA keys. </p>

<p>We now support SSL between your router and your servers for security.
See <a href="http://zzz.i2p/topics/1495">http://zzz.i2p/topics/1495</a> for more information.</p>

<p>As usual, we recommend that you update to this release.
The best way to maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
Several members of the I2P team will be at 30C3 in Hamburg this year.
Come say hello and ask for an I2P sticker.
Thanks to everyone for their support this year.
