{% block title %}Bounty I2P vuze plugin{% endblock %}
{% block content %}<p>To improve I2P usage and attract more people
into I2P torrent P2P I setout the bounty for a working I2P vuze
plugin.
The plugin needs to be official and submitted to vuze for publication
on their webpage/repository for plugins.
It should be easy to install and configured, work smooth and flawless.
Configuration should be friendly to starters and made easy to be anonymous.
It should work with *.b32.i2p destinations as with signed (516++ bits) 
destinations.

For bounties to be declared done and paid, we need the plugin AND the source.

free to distribute). To claim the bounty the author must not be paid by other
organizations or teams for this work (e.g. GSoC students are not valid).</p>
