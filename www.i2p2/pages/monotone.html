  >This is a revised version of <a href="transition-guide.html"
    >Complication’s original guide</a
    > detailing the use of Monotone in I2P development. For basic instructions see the <a href="newdevelopers.html"
    >quick-start guide</a
    >.</em
  ></p
><p
>I2P has a distributed development model. The source code is replicated across independently administered <a href="http://www.monotone.ca/"
  >Monotone</a
  > repositories — typically one repository per developer or contributor — among which development work can be shared and merged cooperatively, and work that’s considered satisfactory is eventually merged into a single trusted repository that serves as the project’s master. In practice however, since contributors are often given commit privileges (after signing the <a href="licenses.html#commit"
  >developer agreement</a
  >), it’s more common for completed work to be pushed directly to the master repository by its original authors.</p
><p
>For I2P development, some of Monotone’s noteworthy qualities are: distributed version control, cryptographic authentication, access control, small size, few dependencies, storage of projects in a compressed SQLite database file, and fitness for use over the I2P network due to its ability to cleanly resume a previously interrupted sync operation.</p

  >Operating a Monotone Client</a
  ></h3
><h4 id="generating-monotone-keys"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Generating Monotone keys</a
  ></h4
><p
>A transport key authenticates your computer to a Monotone repository server, granting you read access. Likewise, a commit key provides write access.</p
><p
>To commit code into Monotone (authenticate your code as originating from you), you are strongly encouraged to use a separate key: a commit key.</p
><p
>If you don’t generate any keys, you can get away with it. Public repositories generally provide read access to anyone, and Monotone will automatically generate temporary keys when you pull code from a repository without specifying a key. However, operating without either key will place limitations on your activities.</p
><p
>Without a transport key, you cannot:</p
><ul
><li
  >pull code from a server which doesn’t allow global read access</li
  ><li
  >push code to any server</li
  ><li
  >run Monotone as a server</li
  ></ul
><p
>Without a commit key, you cannot:</p
><ul
><li
  >commit any code</li
  ></ul
><p
>If you are certain that you will not be doing any of that, you can skip generating keys, and proceed to the <a href="#trust-and-initializing-your-repository"
  >next section</a
  >. If you want to generate keys, read the following.</p
><p
>By convention, keys are named like an e-mail addresses. A corresponding e-mail address does not need to exist. For example, your keys might be named:</p
><pre
><code
  >complication@mail.i2p
complication-transport@mail.i2p
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Monotone stores keys under <code
  >/home/username/.monotone/keys</code
  >, in text files which are named identically to the keys, for example:</p
><pre
><code
  >/home/complication/.monotone/keys/complication@mail.i2p
</code
  ></pre
><p
>To generate a transport key, and optionally also a commit key, issue in any directory commands like the following:</p
><pre
><code
  >$ mtn genkey yourname-transport@someplace
$ mtn genkey yourname@someplace
</code
  ></pre
><p
>While creating keys, Monotone will prompt you for a passphrase to protect your keys against unauthorized use by encrypting them. It is very strongly recommended to protect a commit key. You may want to skip passphrase-protecting a transport key if you run Monotone in server mode, and require capability for automatic restarts.</p
><h4 id="trust-and-initializing-your-repository"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Trust, and initializing your repository</a
  ></h4
><p
><em
  >Monotone helps ensure that nobody can easily impersonate a developer without others noticing. Since developers make mistakes and can be compromised, nothing but manual review can ensure quality of code. Authentication ensures you read the right diffs. It does not replace reading diffs.</em
  ></p
><p
>A Monotone repository is a single file (an SQLite database) which contains in compressed form, all of the project’s source code and history.</p
><p
>During the course of work, a Monotone repository may come contain code which you aren’t actively working with, or even code which you don’t entirely trust. This is normal. For example, you may trust a repository which gave you code, but not the author who committed it there.</p
><p
>When set up correctly (meaning: <em
  >do not</em
  > skip the sections <a href="#obtaining-and-deploying-developers-keys"
  >Obtaining and deploying developers’ keys</a
  > or <a href="#setting-up-trust-evaluation-hooks"
  >Setting up trust evaluation hooks</a
  >) Monotone evaluates whether it trusts the committer of code, and prevents code from untrusted code from being checked out.</p
><p
>Code authentication happens not during syncs to repositories, but when checking out or updating a working copy from your local repository.</p
><p
>Commands exist which let you clean your repository of untrusted code, but they are rarely needed, if push access on the server is well managed.</p
><p
>A repository can hold many branches. For example, our repository holds the following main branches:</p
><ul
><li
  ><code
    >i2p.i2p</code
    > — The I2P router and associated programs</li
  ><li
  ><code
    >i2p.www</code
    > — The I2P project website</li
  ><li
  ><code
    >i2p.syndie</code
    > — Syndie, a distributed forums tool</li
  ></ul
><p
>For historical reasons, you may find other branches, but they are not used. They originate from the import of the CVS repository which was used before <code
  >dev.i2p</code
  > disappeared.</p
><p
>By convention, the I2P Monotone repository is named <code
  >i2p.mtn</code
  >. Before you pull source code from servers, you need to initialize your own repository (it can become a new server if needed).</p
><p
>To initialize your local repository, change into a directory where you want the <code
  >i2p.mtn</code
  > file and branch directories to appear, and issue the following command:</p
><pre
><code
  >$ mtn --db=&quot;i2p.mtn&quot; db init
</code
  ></pre
><h4 id="obtaining-and-deploying-developers-keys"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Obtaining and deploying developers’ keys</a
  ></h4
><p
>Keys which developers use to commit code are essential for trust evaluation in Monotone. If you aren’t running a Monotone server, you don’t need their transport keys.</p
><p
>Developers’ commit keys are provided GPG-signed below. Keys for zzz, Complication and welterde are provided clearsigned. The key for jrandom must be verified differently, since he’s away, and only left a binary detached signature for his key.</p
><p
>To import developers’ keys after verifying them, copy them all into a single text file. Create this file (e.g. <code
  >keys.txt</code
  >) in the same directory where <code
  >i2p.mtn</code
  > is. Import it by issuing:</p
><pre
><code
  >$ cat keys.txt | mtn --db=&quot;i2p.mtn&quot; read
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Leave <code
  >/home/username/.monotone/keys</code
  > purely for your own keys. Monotone doesn’t like having duplicate keys in two places. If you deploy other people’s keys into that directory, you will soon also have them in <code
  >i2p.mtn</code
  >, and Monotone will start reporting an error: “extraneous data in keystore”.</p
><p
><em
  >It would be inappropriate to supply anyone’s GPG public keys in this guide. Find the public keys from an independent source. Current developers have their GPG keys on their eepsites. Jrandom’s Syndie release key can be found on a number of public keyservers.</em
