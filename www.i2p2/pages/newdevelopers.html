  So you want to start work on I2P? Great!
  Here's a quick guide to getting started
  on contributing to the website or the software, doing development or creating translations.

<h2 id="basic-study">Basic 'study'</h2>

<p>
  Basic development on the I2P router or the embedded applications uses Java as the main development language.
  If you don't have experience with Java, you can always have a look at <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/">Thinking in Java</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Study the <a href="how_intro.html">how intro</a>,
  the <a href="how.html">other "how" documents</a>,
  the <a href="techintro.html">tech intro</a>,
  and associated documents.
  These will give you a good overview of how I2P is structured and what different things it does.
</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-i2p-code">Getting the I2P code</h2>

<p>
  For development on the i2p router or the embedded applications,
  get the monotone source repository installed - short instructions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Install <a href="http://www.monotone.ca/">monotone</a>.
    Monotone is a version control system.
    We use it because it allows us to keep track of who does what changes to the source code (and for a lot of complicated things, but 'keeping track of changes' is the basic idea).
  </li>
  <li>Skim over the <a href="http://monotone.ca/docs/Tutorial.html">monotone tutorial</a>, to make sure you understand the concepts.</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you want to remain anonymous, you need to do an additional step, to set up a connection to a monotone server over I2P:
    </p>
    <p>
      Enable the <a href="i2ptunnel.html">i2ptunnel</a> client tunnel on port 8998 pointing to mtn.i2p2.i2p (if you are having nonce issues, see <a href="http://trac.i2p2.de/ticket/64">ticket #64</a> for a workaround)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Pick a directory where you want to put all your I2P files, and create a monotone database: <code><b>mtn -d i2p.mtn db init</b></code>
  </li>
  <li>Define the trust list by creating <code>~/.monotone/monotonerc</code> (or <code>_MTN/monotonerc</code> in the i2p.i2p workspace) with the following contents:
{% include "_monotonerc.html" %}
</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the <a href="developerskeys.html">developer's commit keys</a> into a new file (e.g. <code>keys.txt</code>) in the same directory
    that <code>i2p.mtn</code> is in. Import the keys into your database with <code>mtn -d i2p.mtn read < keys.txt</code>.
  <li>
    Pull the I2P sources to your machine. This may take a long time, especially if you are doing this over I2P!
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymously: <code><b>mtn -d i2p.mtn pull 127.0.0.1:8998 i2p.i2p</b></code></li>
      <li>
        <p>
           Non-anonymously: <code><b>mtn -d i2p.mtn pull mtn.i2p2.de i2p.i2p</b></code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, instead of 'mtn.i2p2.de', you can also download from mtn.i2p-projekt.de.
        </p>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    All the sources are now present on your machine, in the database file. To make them available in a directory, you need to check them out: <code><b>mtn -d i2p.mtn co --branch=i2p.i2p</b></code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The above command creates a directory i2p.i2p, which contains all of the I2P sources.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>
  To download the website files instead of the I2P source files, use 'i2p.www' instead of 'i2p.i2p'.
</p>
<p>
  The initial pull may take several hours using the tunnel.
  If it fails after a partial pull, simply rerun it, it will start where it left off.
  If you are in a hurry, use the non-anonymous access.
</p>
<p>
  A full list of branches, including i2p.i2p and i2p.www can be found on <a href="http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/viewmtn/">viewmtn</a>.
</p>
<p>
  A long explanation about using monotone is available on the <a href="monotone.html">monotone page</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="building-i2p">Building I2P</h2>

<p>
  To compile the code, you need the Sun Java Development Kit 6 or higher, or equivalent JDK
  (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun JDK 6</a> strongly recommended) and
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache ant</a>
  version 1.7.0 or higher.
  If you go are working on the main I2P code, you can go into the i2p.i2p directory and run 'ant' to see the build options.
</p>

<p>
  To build or work on console translations, you need
  the xgettext, msgfmt, and msgmerge tools from the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU gettext package</a>.
</p>

<p>
  For development on new applications,
  see the <a href="applications">application development guide</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="development-ideas">Development ideas</h2>
<p>
  See <a href="http://zzz.i2p/forums/3">zzz's TODO lists</a>, 
  <a href="todo.html">this website's TODO list</a> or
  <a href="http://trac.i2p2.de/report/1">Trac</a> 
  for ideas.
</p>

<h2 id="making-the-results-available">Making the results available</h2>

<p>
  See the bottom of <a href="licenses.html">licenses.html</a> for
  commit privilege requirements. You need these to put code into i2p.i2p (not required for the website!).
</p>

<p>
  Short version of how to generate and use keys if you plan to commit:
  <ul>
    <li>mtn genkey yourname-transport@mail.i2p <i>(use an empty passphrase)</i>
    <li>mtn genkey yourname@mail.i2p <i>(enter a passphrase)</i>
    <li>mtn pubkey yourname-transport@mail.i2p <i>(<a href="mailto:mtn@welterde.de">send</a> this to a mtn repo operator to get push privileges)</i>
    <li>mtn pubkey yourname@mail.i2p <i>(send this to <a href="mailto:zzz@mail.i2p">a release manager</a> to get commit privileges - not required for website)</i>
    <li>mtn ci -k yourname@mail.i2p <i>(check in with this key)</i>
    <li>mtn sync -k yourname-transport@mail.i2p <i>(push with this key)</i>
  </ul>
  Long version: see the <a href="monotone.html">monotone page</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="get-to-know-us">Get to know us!</h2>
<p>
  The developers hang around on IRC. They can be reached on the Freenode network, and on the I2P internal networks. The usual place to look is #i2p. Join the channel and say hi!
  We also have <a href="dev-guidelines.html">additional guidelines for regular developers</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>
  Website and router console translators: See the <a href="newtranslators.html">New Translators Page</a>
  for next steps.
</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
