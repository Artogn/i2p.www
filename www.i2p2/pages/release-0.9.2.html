<p>

0.9.2 includes extensive low-level changes to improve the performance and efficiency of the router.
We have updated our UPnP library, to hopefully make UPnP work for more people.
I2PSnark now has DHT support, but it is not yet enabled by default, as we plan to do more
testing during the upcoming 0.9.3 development cycle.
As usual, there's also lots of bug fixes in this release, so updating is recommended.

<p><strong>Major Changes</strong></p>

<p>- SSU: Fix several problems in our UDP transport, to improve efficiency and reliability for connection setup. Also improve defenses against various types of bad input.
<br />- UPnP: Updated our library to fix several issues, should work for more routers now
<br />- Transport: Improve performance in both our TCP and UDP transports, to benefit high-bandwidth routers
<br />- Crypto: The thresholds and number of ElGamal/AES Session Tags delivered are now much more flexible, which should lessen protocol overhead and reduce stalls caused by dropped tags.
