{% block title %}Bittorrent over I2P{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
Updated May 2011, current as of router version 0.8.6


<p>There are several bittorrent clients and trackers on I2P.
As I2P addressing uses a Destination instead of an IP and port, minor
changes are required to tracker and client software for operation on I2P.
These changes are specified below.
Note carefully the guidelines for compatibility with older I2P clients and trackers.
</p>
<p>
This page specifies protocol details common to all clients and trackers.
Specific clients and trackers may implement other unique features or protocols.
</p>
<p>
We welcome additional ports of client and tracker software to I2P.
</p>



<h2>Announces</h2>
<p>
Clients generally include a fake port=6881 parameter in the announce, for compatibility with older trackers.
Trackers may ignore the port parameter, and should not require it.
</p>
<p>
The ip parameter is the base 64 of the client's
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destination</a>,
using the I2P Base 64 alphabet [A-Z][a-z][0-9]-~.
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destinations</a>
are 387+ bytes, so the Base 64 is 516+ bytes.
Clients generally append ".i2p" to the Base 64 Destination for compatibility with older trackers.
Trackers should not require an appended ".i2p".
</p>
<p>
Other parameters are the same as in standard bittorrent.
</p>
<p>
While all current Destinations for clients are exactly 387 bytes, a tracker should not
presume that will always be so. A reasonable maximum to assume, for now, is 475 bytes.
As the tracker must decode the Base64 to deliver compact responses (see below),
the tracker should probably decode and reject bad Base64 when announced.
</p>
<p>
The default response type is non-compact. Clients may request a compact response with
the parameter compact=1. A tracker may, but is not required to, return
a compact response when requested.
</p>
<p>
Developers of new I2P clients
are strongly encouraged to implemenent announces over their own tunnel rather than
the HTTP client proxy at port 4444. Doing so is both more efficient and it allows
destination enforcement by the tracker (see below).
</p>


<h2>Non-Compact Tracker Responses</h2>
<p>
The non-compact response is just as in standard bittorrent, with an I2P "ip".
</p>
<p>
Trackers generally include a fake port key, or use the port from the announce, for compatibility with older clients.
Clients must ignore the port parameter, and should not require it.
</p>
<p>
The value of the ip key is the base 64 of the client's
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destination</a>, as described above.
Trackers generally append ".i2p" to the Base 64 Destination if it wasn't in the announce ip, for compatibility with older clients.
Clients should not require an appended ".i2p" in the responses.
</p>
<p>
Other response keys and values are the same as in standard bittorrent.
</p>



<h2>Compact Tracker Responses</h2>
<p>
In the compact response, the value of the "peers" dictionary key is a single byte string,
whose length is a multiple of 32 bytes.
This string contains the concatenated
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#type_Hash">32-byte SHA-256 Hashes</a>
of the binary
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destinations</a>
of the peers.
This hash must be computed by the tracker, unless destination enforcement
(see below) is used, in which case the hash delivered in the X-I2P-DestHash
or X-I2P-DestB32 HTTP headers may be converted to binary and stored.
The peers key may be absent, or the peers value may be zero-length.
</p>
<p>
While compact response support is optional for both clients and trackers, it is highly
recommended as it reduces the nominal response size by over 90%.
</p>



<h2>Destination Enforcement</h2>
<p>
Some, but not all, I2P bittorrent clients announce over their own tunnels.
Trackers may choose to prevent spoofing by requiring this, and verifying the
client's
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destination</a>
using HTTP headers added by the I2PTunnel HTTP Server tunnel.
The headers are X-I2P-DestHash, X-I2P-DestB64, and X-I2P-DestB32, which are
different formats for the same information.
These headers cannot be spoofed by the client.
A tracker enforcing destinations need not require the ip announce parameter at all.
</p>
<p>
As several clients use the HTTP proxy instead of their own tunnel for announces,
destination enforcement will prevent usage by those clients unless or until
those clients are converted to announcing over their own tunnel.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, as the network grows, so will the amount of maliciousness,
so we expect that all trackers will eventually enforce destinations.
Both tracker and client developers should anticipate it.
</p>



<h2>Announce Host Names</h2>
<p>
Announce URL host names in torrent files generally follow the
<a href="naming.html">I2P naming standards</a>.
In addition to host names from address books and ".b32.i2p" Base 32 hostnames,
the full Base 64 Destination (with [or without?] ".i2p" appended) should be supported.
Non-open trackers should recognize their own host name in any of these formats.
</p>
<p>
To preserve anonymity,
clients should generally ignore non-I2P announce URLs in torrent files.
</p>



<h2>Outbound Connections</h2>
<p>
I2P uses 387+ byte
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destinations</a> for addresses, as explained above.
</p>
<p>
If the client has only the hash of the destination (such as from a compact response or PEX), it must perform a lookup
by encoding it with Base 32, appending ".b32.i2p", and querying the Naming Service,
which will return the full Destination if available.
</p>
<p>
If the client has a peer's full Destination it received in a non-compact response, it should use it
directly in the connection setup.
Do not convert a Destination back to a Base 32 hash for lookup, this is quite inefficient.
</p>



<h2>Cross-Network Prevention</h2>
<p>
To preserve anonymity,
I2P bittorrent clients generally do not support non-I2P announces or peer connections.
I2P HTTP outproxies often block announces.
There are no known SOCKS outproxies supporting bittorrent traffic.
</p>
<p>
To prevent usage by non-I2P clients via an HTTP inproxy, I2P trackers often
block accesses or announces that contain an X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.
Trackers should reject standard network announcesw with IPv4 or IPv6 IPs, and not deliver them in responses.
</p>



<h2>PEX</h2>
<p>
I2P PEX is based on ut_pex.
As there does not appear to be a formal specification of ut_pex available,
it may be necessary to review the libtorrent source for assistance.
It is an extension message, identified as "i2p_pex" in
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html">the extension handshake</a>.
It contains a bencoded dictionary with up to 3 keys, "added", "added.f", and "dropped".
The added and dropped values are each a single byte string, whose length is a multiple of 32 bytes.
These byte strings are the concatenated SHA-256 Hashes of the binary
<a href="common_structures_spec.html#struct_Destination">Destinations</a>
of the peers.
This is the same format as the peers dictionary value in the i2p compact response format specified above.
The added.f value, if present, is the same as in ut_pex.
</p>



<h2>DHT</h2>
<p>
DHT is not fully implemented in any I2P client.
Preliminary differences from
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html">BEP 5</a>
are described below, and are subject to change.
Contact the I2P developers if you wish to develop a client supporting DHT.
</p>
<p>
I2P DHT will probably use a different bit in the options handshake
than standard DHT. Or maybe use an extension message instead.
</p>
<p>
The UDP (datagram) port listed in the compact node info is used
to receive repliable (signed) datagrams.
This is used for queries, except for announces.
We call this the "query port".
</p>
<p>
In addition to that UDP port, we use a second datagram
port equal to the signed port + 1. This is used to receive
unsigned (raw) datagrams for replies, errors, and announce queries..
We call this the "response port".
</p>
<p>
Compact peer info is 32 bytes (32 byte SHA256 Hash)
instead of 4 byte IP + 2 byte port. There is no peer port.
</p>
<p>
Compact node info is 54 bytes (20 byte SHA1 Hash + 32 byte SHA256 Hash + 2 byte port)
instead of 20 byte SHA1 Hash + 4 byte IP + 2 byte port.
</p>
<p>
The query port is exchanged with a standard PORT message. The response port is always the query port + 1.
</p>
<p>
The trackerless torrent dictionary "nodes" key is a list of
32 byte binary strings (SHA256 Hashes) instead of a list of lists
containing a host string and a port integer.
Alternative: A single byte string with concatenated hashes.
