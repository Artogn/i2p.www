To run locally (for testing purposes):

- Install proxychains, configure it for Tor

- Pull in the dependencies:
$ proxychains ./setup_venv.sh
(you can also pull them non-anon by leaving out proxychains)

- Compile translations (if you want to see them):
$ ./compile-messages.sh

- Start the webserver:
$ ./runserver.py

- Open the site at http://localhost:5000/

# MIRROR OPERATORS #

If you want to mirror the I2P website, thanks! Here is a checklist:

- Do not edit any of the files in i2p2www/ 
  - In particular, do not change the CANONICAL_DOMAIN variable in
    i2p2www/__init__.py, it needs to point to the official site for SEO.
- If you need to edit variables in etc/update.vars, copy the file to
  etc/update.vars.custom and edit appropriately. The only variable you
  may need to edit is MTNURL in etc/update.vars (if your Monotone client
  tunnel is listening on a different port).
- If you want to enable caching, copy i2p2www/settings.py.sample to
  i2p2www/settings.py and edit appropriately.
- Add ./site-updater.sh to your crontab. This will keep the site updated,
  recompile the translations when necessary, and touch a file in /tmp/
  (look in etc/update.vars for the filename, your webserver should restart
  WSGI when the timestamp of this file changes).
