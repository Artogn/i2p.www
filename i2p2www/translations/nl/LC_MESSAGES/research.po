"The standard mode of operation is to have one JVM per router instance; "
"hence running multiple copies of I2P on a single machine is inadvisable, "
"both due to the potential resource drain and the certain port conflicts. "
"To better facilitate setting up small test networks, I2P has a "
"multirouter mode which enables multiple distinct routers to be run in the"
" same JVM."

"Additionally, I2P can be started in a virtual network mode. This mode "
