"0.9.3 includes extensive low-level changes to the queueing of messages in"
" the router.  We implement the CoDel Active Queue Management (AQM) "
"algorithm.  We also unify the queueing and priority mechanisms in the "
"transports to aid diagnosis and reduce network latency.  Work continues "
"on fixing UDP transport bugs and making UDP more resistant to attacks.  "
"There are more changes to improve the performance of the router and "
"reduce its memory usage.  Also, we enable i2psnark's DHT support, "
"introduced last release, by default."

"Vi implementerar CoDel Active Queue Management (AQM) algoritmen. "
"Vi förenar även kö och prioritets mekanismerna i transportlagret för att "
"underlätta diagnos och reducera nätverksfördröjningar. "
"Arbete fortsätter med att korrigera buggar i UDP transportlagret och att "
"göra UDP mer motståndskraftigt mot attacker. "
"Det finns fler förändringar som förbättrar prestandan av routern och "
"reducerar dess minnesanvändning. "
"Vi slår även på i2psnarks DHT-stöd, som introducerades i förra releasen, "
"som standard."
