"I2P can be run as a separate test network by controlling the locations "
"that a new router reseeds from so that it only finds other test routers."

msgid ""
"The standard mode of operation is to have one JVM per router instance; "
"hence running multiple copies of I2P on a single machine is inadvisable, "
"both due to the potential resource drain and the certain port conflicts. "
"To better facilitate setting up small test networks, I2P has a "
"multirouter mode which enables multiple distinct routers to be run in the"
" same JVM."

"Additionally, I2P can be started in a virtual network mode. This mode "
"disables all transports, allowing the router to be tested in isolation "
"without network traffic. To enable this mode, add "
"<code>i2p.vmCommSystem=true</code> to the router.config before starting."

"their ideas on the live network, if an attack becomes apparent and we "
"don't have any line of communication then we will end up taking "
"countermeasures which could interfere with the test."
