14:05 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:05 < jrandom> 1) Network status and 0.3.4.3</p>
14:05 < jrandom> 2) Stasher</p>
14:06 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
14:06 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:06  * jrandom waves to all the i[2i]p &amp; freenode gang</p>
14:06  * hypercubus waves</p>
14:06 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted a few seconds ago to http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-August/000409.html</p>
14:06 < deer> &lt;oOo_itwop&gt; It's Show Time !</p>
14:07 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; seems i2p irc doesn't love me. or it wants to keep me hot longer by regular interruptions</p>
14:07 < jrandom> heh, yeah, that actually leads us in to 1) Network status and 0.3.4.3 :)</p>
14:07 < jrandom> the network is pretty shitty right now</p>
14:07 < kaji> yep</p>
14:08 < jrandom> the problems are showing up largely from incompatabilities with the different releases that people are running, which has been injecting all sorts of neat ways to break things</p>
14:09 < jrandom> if you check the links in the email, you can see the flooding and netDb DoS that has gone on, but it has largely subsided</p>
14:09 < jrandom> we still do have a half dozen people running old releases (and probably 20-25 people running vanilla 0.3.4.2, with its own problems)</p>
14:10 < jrandom> i appreciate your patience as we move forward on this.  i dont want to rush a new release without first being able to effeciently route around bad nodes</p>
14:10 < jrandom> in the past we have been able to route around bad nodes that merely perform poorly, but havent had to deal with nodes who do Bad Things</p>
14:11 < deer> &lt;oOo_itwop&gt; Guinea pigs bows to jrandom !</p>
14:11 < duck> will the next release be backward compatible?</p>
14:11 < jrandom> perhaps duck.  if we can work around those old nodes, there's no reason to make it incompatible</p>
14:12 < duck> cool</p>
14:12 < jrandom> anyway, there's lots of activity going on, even though y'all aren't seeing any new releases yet</p>
14:13 < jrandom> i dont know when 0.3.4.3 will be out.  perhaps tomorrow, or perhaps later this week.</p>
14:14 < jrandom> anyone have any questions / comments / concerns they'd like to bring up wrt network status?</p>
14:14 < kaji> will *.3 have hyper's new gui install?</p>
14:14 < jrandom> probably not</p>
14:14 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; the network looks good to me in the profiles of my boxes, just that i frequently drop</p>
14:15 < jrandom> yeah, i understand mule.  the irc con has been pretty bad for me too, but its been getting better lately</p>
14:15 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; but i missed most of your discussion, so i'll shut up for now</p>
14:15 < jrandom> if you want to try pulling from CVS, that should have an improvement, but there are frequent updates so you may want to wait until the release</p>
14:16 < jrandom> ok anything else?  if not, moving briskly along to 2) Stasher</p>
14:16 < kaji> woot stasher</p>
14:17 < jrandom> stasher is looking pretty cool.  still quite limited functionality, but its making progress</p>
14:17 < jrandom> if aum were awake he could give us an update...</p>
14:17 < jrandom> aum: ping?  :)</p>
14:17 < kaji>  /kick aum</p>
14:18 < jrandom> (its early for him though, so he is probably still sleeping)</p>
14:18 < duck> how selfish</p>
14:18 < hypercubus> i'm impressed by it so far</p>
14:18 < jrandom> Anyway, installing and running stasher is pretty painless, so if you can help him test it out, that'd be great</p>
14:18 < jrandom> yeah, mos' def'</p>
14:18 < hypercubus> it has allowed me to pull off mass goatse'ing</p>
14:19 < jrandom> and whats an app without a goatse, 'eh?  </p>
14:19 < hypercubus> you gotta love an app that lets you upload goatse to someone's drive ;-)</p>
14:19 < aum> pong</p>
14:19 < jrandom> w0ah </p>
14:19 < jrandom> 'mornin aum</p>
14:19 < deer> &lt;ardvark&gt; quick question: do I get stasher via i2p CVS?</p>
14:19 < aum> hi all</p>
14:19 < jrandom> ardvark: in i2p/apps/stasher/</p>
14:19 < aum> ardvark: hi!!!! :) long time!</p>
14:20 < deer> &lt;ardvark&gt; yes hi aum! good to see you mate!</p>
14:20 < aum> ardvark: prolly easier via tarball - http://stasher.i2p or http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/stasher</p>
14:21 < deer> &lt;ardvark&gt; ok aum, I got the tarball but needs other stuff it says?  I'll not hold back the meeting, maybe I can contact you?</p>
14:21 < aum> sure thing</p>
14:22 < hypercubus> so, any update on stasher aum? ;-)</p>
14:23 < aum> small update, i've added a '-l' option which allows local-only get/put</p>
14:23 < aum> also, thinking of implementing a 'put' option which returns immediately </p>
14:24 < aum> last night, was thinking thru issues of implementing freenet keytypes</p>
14:24 < hypercubus> i'd like to request that successful put operations return a status... scp and many other command line net apps do this</p>
14:24 < jrandom> SSK would quite kick ass</p>
14:25 < jrandom> (while CHK is of course what imho is most essential)</p>
14:25 < MikeW> One thing I always found interesting about freenet was: It would tell you why there could be high CPU usage. Sometimes (usually at startup for a minute or two) and randomly, CPU usage spikes to 100%, perhaps a estimation why it thinks java is eating my cpu?</p>
14:25 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Splitfiles ^^</p>
14:26 < jrandom> MikeW: if i2p is eating your CPU there is most certainly something broken going on</p>
14:26 < aum> i've tentatively implemented splitfiles already, but haven't enabled it - want to test locally first</p>
14:26 < jrandom> MikeW: you can tell exactly whats going on in your router by looking at the 'current job' in the router console, which is (almost always) where the CPU crunch is</p>
14:26 < jrandom> ah cool aum</p>
14:27 < aum> due to a recursive algo, the splitfiles thing should allow unlimited file sizes when it's done</p>
14:27 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Great, splitfiles are mandatory for serious goatse and pr0n stuff...</p>
14:27 < deer> &lt;identiguy&gt; aum: does that include FEC?</p>
14:27 < aum> fec not needed</p>
14:27 < aum> fec is only required on flaky networks</p>
14:27 < deer> &lt;identiguy&gt; Ah, I see.</p>
14:27 < aum> i'm using kademlia, which has far better retrievability guarantee</p>
14:27 < duck> unless nodes go down</p>
14:28 < aum> plus, i can't be fscked doing fec anyway, it's a pain</p>
14:28 < aum> duck: there's redundancy - refer the 'k' value in kademlia</p>
14:28 < jrandom> duck: with a k of 20, even without any republishing it'd be ok ;)</p>
14:28 < duck> heh, okay</p>
14:28 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; aum: fec might help in case a number of nodes are removed</p>
14:28 < jrandom> (and with republishing, it'd only hurt if all k died at the same time)</p>
14:28 < aum> naah, i'll just increase k</p>
14:28 < jrandom> k of 20 imho is pretty substantial</p>
14:29 < jrandom> (since that means you have 20 full replicas of the file)</p>
14:29 < hypercubus> users can always use standalone fec tools</p>
14:29 < MikeW> jrandom: Under JobQueue, runners:1, active jobs:0, just finished:1, ready/waiting: 0, timed: 28</p>
14:29 < aum> that means 20 goatses, guys :P</p>
14:29 < hypercubus> and publish the results</p>
14:29 < duck> what about the britneyspears effect?</p>
14:29 < duck> of very popular keys ending up on 1 node</p>
14:29 < jrandom> (aka insert a 740MB file and you get 14.8GB of data you need to send)</p>
14:30 < aum> duck: popularity is not a concept in kademlia</p>
14:30 < duck> (ofcourse with 32KB keys that might not be terrible)</p>
14:30 < jrandom> ok cool MikeW, but is i2p eating your CPU now?</p>
14:30 < deer> &lt;ardvark&gt; all these kademlia messages I see on i2p are stasher related?</p>
14:30 < MikeW> jrandom: yes</p>
14:30 < aum> duck: and kademlia has no relaying</p>
14:30 < hypercubus> ardvark: the stuff in the router console is the netdb kad implementation</p>
14:31 < aum> the ideas of 'relaying', 'popularity', 'caching' etc are for freenet, which has to expose itself naked to the world, without the cloaking of I2P</p>
14:31 < deer> &lt;ardvark&gt; runnin i2p and tor here and my cpu usage is at 3% now so :/  *shrug*</p>
14:31 < jrandom> MikeW: then your router is unable to maintain connections and is gobbling CPU doing lots of concurrent connection establishment</p>
14:31 < duck> ok, my brain is rotten by freenet</p>
14:31 < duck> please have mercy :)</p>
14:31 < deer> * shendaras comforts.</p>
14:31 < jrandom> MikeW: if you can hang around after the meeting to debug, that'd be great</p>
14:32 < MikeW> will do</p>
14:32 < jrandom> ok cool aum, anything people can do to help?</p>
14:32 < jrandom> or should we just kick the tires and file bugs?</p>
14:33 < duck> I am trying to get used to leo</p>
14:33 < aum> yep, file bugs to the list, if that's ok people</p>
14:33 < duck> already like it more than eclipse</p>
14:33 < hypercubus> what's leo?</p>
14:33 < jrandom> (uh oh, here comes the rant ;)</p>
14:33 < aum> duck: i use nothing but leo these days - except emacs for quick hacks, and zile for even quicker hacks</p>
14:34 < hypercubus> as long as you're not using vi or emacs ;-)</p>
14:34 < aum> http://leo.sf.net - gives you an outline view of your code</p>
14:34 < hypercubus> but i'll have to try this leo myself</p>
14:34 < aum> leo even integrates with emacs if you want</p>
14:34 < hypercubus> it's not an editor?</p>
14:35 < aum> &lt;bile&gt;</p>
14:35 < aum> fucking msvc - it allows __int64 for 64-bit ints, but doesn't allow 'LL' or 'ULL' for 64-bit int literals</p>
14:35 < aum> !!</p>
14:35 < aum> &lt;/bile&gt;</p>
14:35 < hypercubus> ah i see</p>
14:37 < jrandom> ok, if thats that, then we've got nothing left and can move to 3) ???</p>
14:37 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to bring up?</p>
14:37 < hypercubus> yeah i guess i'll say a bit about the new direction of the installer</p>
14:37 < jrandom> ok word</p>
14:38 < hypercubus> from 0.4 onward, command line users will merely grab the i2p tarball and unpack it, then run a script to start the router and pop open the router console in lynx or whatever</p>
14:39 < hypercubus> so not much has changed, except you don't have to go through a silly Q/A session with an installer</p>
14:39 < hypercubus> you do all the configuration in the router console</p>
14:39 < hypercubus> for GUI users, we have something spiffy</p>
14:39 < jrandom> (w00t)</p>
14:40 < hypercubus> which you can preview at http://files.hypercubus.i2p/install.jar</p>
14:40 < jrandom> or from cvs (ant pkg ; java -jar install.jar) right?</p>
14:40 < aum> hypercubus: how are you going with the winstaller? does it autodetect/autodownload/autoinstall java ?</p>
14:41 < hypercubus> menu shortcuts are forthcoming, as well as systray integration and a way to install the router as a daemon</p>
14:41 < aum> daemon? as in windows 'service' ?</p>
14:41 < hypercubus> no, at least not for the forseeable future, they will need to click on a link on the i2p site that takes them to the official java download page</p>
14:42 < hypercubus> the installer requires java, but that's ok since i2p does as well</p>
14:42 < aum> hypercubus: sorry, but that'll lose 80% of users</p>
14:42 < hypercubus> name one java project that doesn't do that</p>
14:42 < jrandom> we'll have it eventually.</p>
14:42 < jrandom> just not now.</p>
14:42 < aum> freenet did it well - their winstaller takes you through the download</p>
14:43 < jrandom> (we have so many other more important fish to fry.  we dont *want* thousands upon thousands of users now)</p>
14:43 < hypercubus> that's a consideration for 1.0</p>
14:43 < hypercubus> i have most of the code to pull it off done already</p>
14:43 < aum> jrandom: i thought you said it would be for 0.4</p>
14:43 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; so you should require that java is built from source :)</p>
14:44 < jrandom> the new installer will be for 0.4</p>
14:44 < hypercubus> we have scrapped all the code i have written thus far</p>
14:44 < hypercubus> in favor of IzPack</p>
14:44 < hypercubus> http://izpack.sf.net</p>
14:44 < jrandom> we can offer a 15MB download bundling the two as one, but most users who will use i2p prior to 1.0 will know what "java" is</p>
14:45 < hypercubus> this gives me time to perfect a fully public domain java installer framework which i eventually hope to move i2p back to</p>
14:45 < hypercubus> but the priority right now is to get rid of the awful current installer ;-)</p>
14:46 < hypercubus> (no offense to whoever hacked it together)</p>
14:46 < deer> &lt;shendaras&gt; Got a 404....</p>
14:46 < duck> http://www.izforge.com/izpack/</p>
14:46 < hypercubus> http://www.izforge.com/izpack/</p>
14:47 < hypercubus> sorry about that</p>
14:47 < hypercubus> anyhow, i would appreciate feedback on the preview installer i've put up on my eepsite</p>
14:48 < hypercubus> it's been tested on *nix and windows, it should work on os x and solaris too</p>
14:48 < jrandom> r0x0r</p>
14:48 < duck> its sweet</p>
14:48 < jrandom> yeah, it kicks ass</p>
14:49 < hypercubus> i may hack izpack to remove those dorky icons from the buttons</p>
14:49 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; hypercubus: will it destroy existing configurations or preserve them?</p>
14:49 < hypercubus> there are no config files contained in the package</p>
14:49 < hypercubus> so it will only overwrite jars and wars</p>
14:49 < jrandom> (at the moment ;)</p>
14:49 < hypercubus> well, we'll take configs into account</p>
14:49 < deer> &lt;mule&gt; k, thanks</p>
14:49 < duck> how will one start the whole jetty thang?</p>
14:50 < duck> still a sh/bat ?</p>
14:50 < jrandom> yes</p>
14:50 < jrandom> the router will start w/ a script, and/or a service (calling that script)</p>
14:50 < hypercubus> yes, and i'll throw in an exe for win users</p>
14:50 < jrandom> w00t</p>
14:50 < hypercubus> that will launch from the Start menu</p>
14:50 < hypercubus> the Windows Start menu</p>
14:51 < hypercubus> should have jetty working as a windows service by tomorrow</p>
14:51  * jrandom mumbles *its not jetty, its i2p*</p>
14:51 < hypercubus> ah right ;-)</p>
14:52 < hypercubus> jetty comes with a win32 service wrapper though</p>
14:52 < hypercubus> we can use it to wrap anything</p>
14:52 < jrandom> yeah, there are 3-4 PD/BSD java service wrappers out there</p>
14:52 < hypercubus> yeah, there are probably some for linux too</p>
14:53 < jrandom> well, linux service == init script :)</p>
14:53 < hypercubus> yeah but linux services are handled differently among even the major distros</p>
14:53 < hypercubus> for example, gentoo uses the rc-setup script scheme</p>
14:54 < jrandom> w3rd</p>
14:54 < hypercubus> anyhow, i'll get it working for all the major distros and *bsd's</p>
14:54 < hypercubus> if not more</p>
14:55 < hypercubus> oops, s/rc-setup/rc-update/</p>
14:55 < hypercubus> ok, that covers everything i guess</p>
14:55 < hypercubus> you guys can wake up now ;-)</p>
14:55 < deer> * shendaras yawns</p>
14:55 < jrandom> cool, thanks hyper, sounds good.</p>
14:56 < jrandom> anyone else have anything they want to bring up?</p>
14:56 < aum> sorry if i missed earlier discussion, but..</p>
14:56 < aum> what's the weather like vis a vis datagram latency etc?</p>
14:57 < jrandom> i dont know about datagrams - the only apps i use run on top of datagrams via streams</p>
14:57 < jrandom> network status is still pretty bad - see status notes @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-August/000409.html</p>
14:58 < aum> k</p>
14:58 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else...</p>
14:58  * jrandom winds up</p>
14:59  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
