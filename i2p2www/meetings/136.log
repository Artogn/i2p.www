14:34 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:34 <@jrandom> 1) 0.5.0.5</p>
14:34 <@jrandom> 2) Bayesian peer profiling</p>
14:34 <@jrandom> 3) Q</p>
14:34 <@jrandom> 4) ???</p>
14:35 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:35  * jrandom waves</p>
14:35  * smeghead outsources his todo list to a parallel universe</p>
14:35 <@jrandom> weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-April/000675.html</p>
14:36 <@jrandom> might as well jump on in to 1) 0.5.0.5</p>
14:36 <+ant> * Connelly waves</p>
14:37 <+protokol> high everyone</p>
14:37 <@jrandom> as mentioned in the status notes (and the current history.txt), we've tracked down some very long lasting netDb bugs</p>
14:37 <@jrandom> in the past, we've been able to fudge it, but 0.5.0.5 forced us to start doing things "right", which is why its been biting us now</p>
14:39 <@jrandom> i expect we'll have a new release sometime tomorrow, so keep an eye out for the update link on your router console :)</p>
14:39 <+protokol> yey</p>
14:39 <@jrandom> actually, thats about all i have on that at the moment - anyone else have anything to add wrt 0.5.0.5?</p>
14:40 <+protokol> nope</p>
14:41 <@jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) Bayesian peer profiling</p>
14:41 <@jrandom> ah, damn, bla dropped off the channel a few mins back</p>
14:42 <@jrandom> well, anyway, I just wanted to point people out at bla's work exploring some more robust profiling techniques</p>
14:42 <+protokol> postponing 2?</p>
14:43 <@jrandom> check out the forum post and the link to theland.i2p for more info, and bounce bla your thoughts :)</p>
14:44 <@jrandom> ok, movin' on to 3) Q</p>
14:44 <@jrandom> aum: you up?</p>
14:44 <@jrandom> hmm, doesnt look like it</p>
14:45 <@jrandom> ok, lots of progress on the Q front, more details for getting involved in alpha testing up @ http://aum.i2p/q/ </p>
14:45 <@jrandom> i'm sure we'll hear more on the list when there's an update available</p>
14:46 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; Q works for me for retrieving content</p>
14:46 <@jrandom> yeah, its been working great for me as well, a few bumps here and there, but quite promising</p>
14:47 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; my Q server stored 2 small items, then got stuck at 100% cpu usage until i killed it</p>
14:47 < zzz> for those who haven't seen it check out my q front end http://flock.i2p/cgi-bin/q</p>
14:47 <@jrandom> zzz: that is quite kickass</p>
14:48  * jrandom forgot the url to that when writing up the status notes (d'oh)</p>
14:50 <@jrandom> ok, anything else on 3) Q?  or shall we move on to 4) ???</p>
14:50  * jrandom considers us moved</p>
14:51 <@jrandom> anyone have anything else they'd like to bring up for the meeting?</p>
14:51 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; i've coding an http/html filter for i2p</p>
14:51 <+protokol> yes</p>
14:51 <+protokol> ian clarke is a troll on slashdot</p>
14:51 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; been coding</p>
14:51 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; should be more safe than freenet's html filterer</p>
14:51 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; if i run out of time i'll just incorporate freenet's filterer</p>
14:51 <@jrandom> cool Connelly, how is it coming along?</p>
14:52 <@jrandom> protokol: and you're a troll in #i2p ;)</p>
14:52 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; so in the end we should have an html filterer for i2p</p>
14:52 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; got html filtering done, now working on css, still haven't looked at header filtering</p>
14:53 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; it's very paranoid :)</p>
14:53 <@jrandom> bitchin</p>
14:53 <+protokol> whitelist?</p>
14:53 <@duck> does it let anything trough at all?</p>
14:53 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; yeah</p>
14:53 <+protokol> if so, what is currently disallowed</p>
14:53 <+protokol> (of any importance)</p>
14:55 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; disallowed of significance: frames and iframes, scripting, optgroup</p>
14:55 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; meta</p>
14:55 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; embedded objects</p>
14:56 <@jrandom> neat.  i'm looking forward to seeing how things progress - any eta on when we could try rigging it up with the eepproxy?</p>
14:56 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; i'll probably have an alpha in 1-2 weeks</p>
14:57 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; so we can test out how it works</p>
14:57 < jrandom2p> kickass</p>
14:58 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; it allows forms, cookies, content caching but those can be turned off in 'paranoid' mode</p>
14:58 <+protokol> why frames and iframes? can you just not block connections to non-i2p sites from them?</p>
14:59 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; it has a cgiproxy like url navigator bar at the top</p>
14:59 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; I suspect the hard thing would be blocking frames between different eepsites</p>
14:59 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; i don't want that hijacked</p>
14:59 <+protokol> i mean can you just block connections</p>
14:59 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; could make it like freenet's proxy where you just enter a url at the beginning</p>
14:59 <+protokol> yeah, frames can rock</p>
14:59 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; and can't enter urls once you start browsing</p>
14:59 < jrandom2p> frames kill kittens</p>
15:00 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; this has to be the oldest framewar ever.  excuse me, flamewar</p>
15:00 < jrandom2p> heh</p>
15:00 <+protokol> i said "can" rock</p>
15:00 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; what we need is our own browser</p>
15:00 <@jrandom> and flying ponies</p>
15:01 <@jrandom> *cough*</p>
15:01 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; i'd prefer an F-16 to a pony</p>
15:01 < Teal`c__> can i have a girl ?</p>
15:01 <+ant> &lt;Connelly&gt; i'll make an option for enabling frames</p>
15:01 <+protokol> Teal`c__: no</p>
15:02 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; Is there a functioning I2P inproxy? bolas.mine.nu appears to be dead.</p>
15:02 <+protokol> from other eepsites, right?</p>
15:02 <@jrandom> BS314159: http://i2p.mine.nu/</p>
15:02 <+protokol> i2p.mine.nu</p>
15:02 < frosk> i2p.mine.nu</p>
15:02 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; thanks</p>
15:02 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; frames are safe if they're inside one eepsite.  frames are safe if all content is static</p>
15:03 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; the only danger is if there's a form in one of the frames, since you might submit information to the wrong party</p>
15:04 <@jrandom> eh, i'm of the opinion the filter should only support what we *need* (and know is safe), and let actual end user demands expand functionality, rather than preemptively assume people will want some things</p>
15:04 <+ant> &lt;BS314159&gt; wise</p>
15:06 <@jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything for the meeting?</p>
15:06 < Teal`c__> sorry didn't know a meeting was on</p>
15:07 <@jrandom> heh no worry, you'll be immortalized in the meeting logs ;)</p>
15:07 <@jrandom> speaking of which</p>
15:07  * jrandom winds up</p>
15:07  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
