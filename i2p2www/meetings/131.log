13:05 <@jrandom> 5) ???</p>
13:05 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
13:05  * jrandom waves</p>
13:05 <@duck> hi</p>
13:05 <@jrandom> weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-March/000616.html</p>
13:05 < null> hi</p>
13:05 <@jrandom> (yeah, i'm late this week, off with my head)</p>
13:06 <@jrandom> while y'all speedreaders dig through that, perhaps we can jump into 1) 0.5.0.1</p>
13:07 <@jrandom> 0.5.0.1 is out, and gets rid of the most ovious bugs from 0.5, but as we've seen, there's still work to be done</p>
13:07 <@jrandom> (current cvs stands at 0.5.0.1-7, I expect at least -8 or -9 before we hit 0.5.0.2)</p>
13:07 <+ugha2p> Hi.</p>
13:08 <+ugha2p> Does CVS HEAD fix that 100% CPU issue?</p>
13:08 <@jrandom> yes, -7 should get the last remnants of it</p>
13:08 <@duck> Does CVS HEAD fix that OOM issue?</p>
13:08 <+detonate> hi</p>
13:08 <@jrandom> no, the OOM is still being tracked down</p>
13:09 <@jrandom> actually... is there a Connelly in the house?</p>
13:09 < ant> &lt;jrandom&gt; nope</p>
13:09 <@jrandom> bugger</p>
13:09 <+ugha2p> jrandom must be going crazy, he is having a dialogue with himself.</p>
13:09 <@jrandom> ok, well, we can see what will be done to get rid of the OOM.  its definitely a show stopper, so there won't be a release until its resolved one way or another</p>
13:10 <+detonate> just in time for the meeting</p>
13:11 <@jrandom> thats about all i have to say for the 0.5.0.1 stuff - anyone else have anything they want to mention/ask/discuss?</p>
13:12 <+ugha2p> jrandom: Err, I haven't actually seen the CPU issue with 0.5.0.1, but it happened twice when I tried 0.5.0.1-5. Am I missing something?</p>
13:12 <+ugha2p> I downgraded back to 0.5.0.1 as a result.</p>
13:13 <+detonate> i had a question, the shutdown seems to take a very long time, and the memory usage spikes by about 40mb during that time</p>
13:13 <+detonate> was wondering if you knew why</p>
13:14 <+detonate> the immediate one, obviously</p>
13:14 <@jrandom> it could happen with 0.5.0.1, you just hadn't run into it.  </p>
13:14 <@jrandom> (its not a common occurrence, and it only hits some people in odd situations)</p>
13:14 <@jrandom> detonate: very long, as in, more than the usual 11-12 minutes?</p>
13:14 <+ugha2p> Well, it hit me twice during a 8-hour period.</p>
13:15 <+detonate> once all the participating tunnels are gone</p>
13:15 <+ugha2p> jrandom: Is it supposed to use up all the CPU and lose all the leases until restarted when that bug occurs?</p>
13:16 <@jrandom> ugha2p: thats a typical result from the bug, yes</p>
13:16 <+detonate> hmm</p>
13:17 <@jrandom> (it happens when the # of tunnel build requests consume sufficient CPU to exceed the time to satisfy a request, causing an additional request to be queued up, etc)</p>
13:17 <+ugha2p> Must have been an extreme coincidence that it only happened to me while on 0.5.0.1-5.</p>
13:18 <@jrandom> ugha2p: its happened to some people repeatably on 0.5.0.1-0, but is fixed in -7.  you can stick with -0 if you prefer, of course</p>
13:18 < cervantes> it was a wonderous godsend</p>
13:18 <+ugha2p> jrandom: I'll try out -7.</p>
13:18 <@jrandom> cool</p>
13:19 <+ugha2p> Although I'm already feeling guilty for giving a bumpy ride to the wiki users so far. :)</p>
13:20 <+ugha2p> One more thing, have you documented the bulk/interactive tunnel types anywhere?</p>
13:20 <+ugha2p> (Except for the source ;)</p>
13:20 <@jrandom> in the changelog.  the only difference is a max window size of 1 message</p>
13:20 <+ugha2p> Oh, okay.</p>
13:21 <@jrandom> ok, anything else on 0.5.0.1, or shall we move on over to 2) roadmap?</p>
13:21 <@duck> move on!</p>
13:21 <@jrandom> consider us moved</p>
13:22 <@jrandom> roadmap updated.  'n stuff.  see the page for details</p>
13:22 < cervantes> eeh, duck ankle bites</p>
13:23 <@jrandom> i'm thinking of pushing some of the strategies from 0.5.1 to 0.6.1 (so we get UDP faster), but we'll see</p>
13:23 <@jrandom> anyone have any questions/comments/concerns/frisbees?</p>
13:23 <+detonate> have you heard from mule lately?</p>
13:23 <+detonate> speaking of udp</p>
13:24 <@jrandom> nope, he was fairly ill last i heard from 'im</p>
13:24 <+detonate> :/</p>
13:24 < jnymo> udp would kick ass</p>
13:25 <@jrandom> s/would/will/</p>
13:25 <@jrandom> hopefully he's off having fun instead though :)</p>
13:25 <+ugha2p> jrandom: What kind of changes would the bandwidth and performance tuning include?</p>
13:26 < jnymo> so, udp basically means connectionless.. which means.. bigger network, right</p>
13:26 <+detonate> udp introduces all sorts of difficulties along with that</p>
13:26 <@jrandom> ugha2p: batching the tunnel message fragments to fit better into the fixed 1024byte tunnel messages, adding per-pool bw throttles, etc</p>
13:27 <+detonate> but yeah</p>
13:27 <@jrandom> detonate: it won't be so bad, the token bucket scheme we have now can handle async requests without a problem</p>
13:27 <@jrandom> (we just obviously wouldn't use the BandwidthLimitedOutputStream, but would ask the FIFOBandwidthLimiter to allocate K bytes)</p>
13:27 <+ugha2p> Would the first one really make much difference? Per-pool throttling doesn't sound urgent.</p>
13:28 <+detonate> that's good then</p>
13:28 <@jrandom> ugha2p: likely, yes.  you can see the exact #s involved by going to /oldstats.jsp#tunnel.smallFragments</p>
13:29 < bla> detonate: How's progress on the reassembly?</p>
13:29 <+detonate> really stalled</p>
13:30 <@jrandom> ugha2p: though its largely dependent upon the type of activity, of course.  chatty comm has more to gain, but bulk comm already fills the fragments fully</p>
13:30 <+ugha2p> jrandom: Ok.</p>
13:30 <+ugha2p> Right.</p>
13:31 <+detonate> i stopped working on it completely and started working on the addressbook-editor</p>
13:31 <+detonate> there's probably a really efficient, well-researched way of doing that sort of thing, but i haven't come across it </p>
13:31 < jnymo> will upd mean people behind nats can get through now?</p>
13:31 <@jrandom> some jnymo </p>
13:31 < jnymo> and use i2p?</p>
13:32 <@jrandom> but first we need to get it to work with udp at all, then we start adding the firewall/nat punching, then the PMTU, etc</p>
13:32 < jnymo> that'll be a boon</p>
13:33 <+detonate> of course if anyone has suggestions on what to do, i'd appreciate them</p>
13:33 <+ugha2p> jrandom: How would UDP help people behind NATs?</p>
13:34 < bla> detonate: TCP (on the regular net) does reassembly. Can those concepts be carried over to the I2P UDP reassembly?</p>
13:34 <+detonate> i haven't looked into how tcp does it</p>
13:34 <@jrandom> ugha2p: there's a lot of trickery we can pull off with consistent port #s, etc.  lots of code & docs out there</p>
13:35 <@jrandom> bla: we'll certainly be using some level of UDP reassembly along tcp-SACK lines</p>
13:35 <+detonate> but if you're going to handle most of what tcp does, you might as well go the NIO route and actually use it</p>
13:35 <+detonate> saving the hassle</p>
13:35 <@jrandom> no, there's substantial reason for why we do want both some reassembly/retransmission and not tcp</p>
13:36 <+detonate> well, the threads thing</p>
13:36 <@jrandom> the transport layer will not need to be fully reliable or ordered, just semireliable and unordered</p>
13:37 <+ugha2p> Can we also expect a drop in memory usage because of fewer threads?</p>
13:37 <@jrandom> yes</p>
13:37 <+ugha2p> A significant drop</p>
13:38 <+ugha2p> ?</p>
13:38 <@jrandom> substantially.  (as well as a drop in memory usage, based off whatever the current OOM is coming from ;)</p>
13:38 <+ugha2p> Right.</p>
13:39 <@jrandom> ok, anything else on 2) roadmap?</p>
13:39 < bla> jrandom: Yeah.</p>
13:40 < bla> jrandom: Will detonate be doing the UDP stuff now? Or else, who will?</p>
13:40 <@jrandom> its a team effort for all who can contribute :)</p>
13:40 <+detonate> heh, i plan on working on udp stuff more, it's less boring than watching tv</p>
13:41 <@jrandom> heh w3wt</p>
13:41 < bla> jrandom: I understand. But for a moment it looked like detonate dropped the project ;)</p>
13:42 <@jrandom> its on the roadmap, it will be done</p>
13:42 <+detonate> sorry for the confusion</p>
13:43 <@jrandom> ok anyone else have anything on 2) roadmap, or shall we mosey on over to 3) addressbook stuff?</p>
13:44 <@jrandom> ok, detonate wanna give us an overview/status report on the editor?</p>
13:45 < bla> detonate: (np)</p>
13:45 <+detonate> ok</p>
13:45 <+detonate> the current state of the editor is here:</p>
13:45 <+detonate> http://detonate.i2p/addressbook-editor/current-state.html</p>
13:45 <+detonate> it still doesn't do any actual editing</p>
13:45 <+detonate> and currently i'm working on the table at the bottom</p>
13:46 <+detonate> i need to read a couple chapters of my jsp book, but after that, you should be able to use it to add/modify entries in the hosts.txt and subscriptions quite easily</p>
13:47 <+detonate> i took a break from it the last 24 hours or so, so that's why there hasn't been much progress</p>
13:47 <+detonate> that's pretty much all</p>
13:47 <@jrandom> w3wt</p>
13:48 < bla> detonate: Looks good</p>
13:49 <@jrandom> yeah, mos' def', I'm looking forward to a way to manage the entries /other/ than just hcaking the hosts file</p>
13:49 <+detonate> thanks</p>
13:49 <+detonate> that's the first time i've used jsp for anything</p>
13:50 <@jrandom> cool</p>
13:51 <@jrandom> oh, i hadn't realized there was the overlap here for subscription management - perhaps smeghead's work can fit in with this as well</p>
13:51 <@jrandom> smeghead: you 'round?  you seen this yet?</p>
13:51 < jnymo> detonate: will there be collision detection and what not?</p>
13:51 <@smeghead> actually i only hashed out some skeleton code on the addressbook console, nothing useful</p>
13:51 <+detonate> yeah, i got tired of that, thank duck for suggesting the idea :)</p>
13:51 <@smeghead> i got sidetracked on the TrustedUpdate thingy</p>
13:52 <@jrandom> ah cool :)</p>
13:53  * jrandom likes sidetracking to add new features </p>
13:53 < bla> smeghead: You mean 1-click updates of I2P from _within_ I2P?</p>
13:53 <@smeghead> so luck, not laziness (at least this time :)</p>
13:53 < cervantes2p> bla: 2 click at least ;-)</p>
13:54 <@jrandom> bah, we can get it down to 1 (reject if bad sig/invalid/etc ;)</p>
13:54 <+detonate> yeah, there will be collision detection, that's currently what i'm working on</p>
13:54 <@jrandom> detonate: doesnt the addressbook itself take care of that?</p>
13:54 <@jrandom> detonate: i thought what you're doing just edited the files?  </p>
13:55 <@jrandom> (the files will be uniq'ed by the addressbook)</p>
13:55 <+detonate> i mean, showing you the collisions from the logs and handling that</p>
13:55 <@jrandom> ah</p>
13:55 <@jrandom> ok cool</p>
13:55 <+detonate> i assume that's what jnymo is talking about</p>
13:55 < Ragnarok> hm, is there anything I can do to make your life easier? :)</p>
13:55 <+detonate> so you can say "replace entry" with the colliding one of your choice</p>
13:55 <@jrandom> nice!</p>
13:58 <@jrandom> Ragnarok: iirc detonate was able to parse out the logfile pretty easily.  do you forsee that format changing?</p>
13:58 < jnymo> detonate: pretty much, yea</p>
13:58 < jnymo> now, is this tied into i2p tightly?  How easily can i put a link+key from my browser into my address book?</p>
13:59 <+detonate> yeah, don't change the format, that'll break everything</p>
13:59 < Ragnarok> the format is highly unlikely to change</p>
14:00 < Ragnarok> though more things may get logged in the future</p>
14:00 <@jrandom> jnymo: the eepproxy doesn't have any hooks into detonate's editor atm, but we could add something down the road</p>
14:00 <+detonate> although if you modified the Conflict lines, that would make them easier to parse</p>
14:00 < cervantes2p> possibly something my firefox plugin could do</p>
14:00 <+detonate> right now there are lots of human readable words that get in the way</p>
14:00 < Ragnarok> modify how?</p>
14:00 <@jrandom> (for instance, perhaps i2paddresshelper might redirect to an editor page)</p>
14:00 < cervantes2p> "click here to add this to your addressbook"</p>
14:00 < Ragnarok> ah...  I want to be nice to the humans, though</p>
14:00 <+detonate> &lt;date&gt;=&lt;host&gt;=&lt;source&gt;=&lt;new destination&gt; would be superior</p>
14:01 <@jrandom> cervantes2p: that going to work like google's page rewriter?  :)</p>
14:01 <+detonate> well, that's what the addressbook-editor is for :)</p>
14:01 <+detonate> it's really not an issue, i've got it covered</p>
14:01 < cervantes2p> jrandom: nah...just have it in the link context menu</p>
14:01 <@jrandom> ooOOoo</p>
14:01 <+detonate> as long as nothing changes radically, things should keep working smoothly</p>
14:02 < cervantes2p> of course I could add a rewriter...but that's just breaks people's page layouts ;-)</p>
14:02 <+detonate> oh, one thing you could do</p>
14:02 <+detonate> because it conflicts with what i do</p>
14:02 <+detonate> make sure all the entries for the hostnames are all-lowercase</p>
14:02 <+detonate> since Legion.i2p is in there</p>
14:02 < cervantes2p> I do want to add a "non i2p link highlighter"</p>
14:02 <+detonate> and i run them all through toLowercase()</p>
14:02 <@jrandom> ah that'd be neat cervantes2p </p>
14:03 <@jrandom> (be sure to only toLowercase the names, base64 is case sensitive ;)</p>
14:03 <+detonate> yeah, only the names</p>
14:04 < jnymo> context menu would be ideal</p>
14:04 <@jrandom> (dont forget the flying ponies!)</p>
14:04 < Ragnarok> I've made address comparisons non-case sensitive in my local branch... I should commit that...</p>
14:04 <+detonate> /make all the hostnames lowercase</p>
14:04 <+detonate>                 pair[0] = pair[0].toLowerCase();</p>
14:05 <+detonate> there, in black and white</p>
14:05 <+detonate> it just does the hostnames</p>
14:05 <@jrandom> aye Ragnarok, give us the goods :)</p>
14:05 < jnymo> why do i always feel i'm the one riding the flying ponies :(</p>
14:06 <@jrandom> thats 'cause you're hoggin' 'em jnymo ;)</p>
14:06 < cervantes2p> jnymo: don't discuss your domestic "arrangements" in a meeting</p>
14:07 <@jrandom> ok, lots of cool stuff going on within the addressbook & editor.  any eta on when we can beta things detonate?  (this week, next week, etc)</p>
14:07 < jnymo> heh</p>
14:07 <+detonate> well, as soon as you can get it to work in jetty, you can put it in beta i think</p>
14:07  * jnymo pulls out his p32-space-modulator</p>
14:07 <@jrandom> it works in jetty</p>
14:07 <+detonate> i have no idea how to get netbeans to precompile them and put them in the war</p>
14:08 <+detonate> as long as people don't change the names of the files in config.txt, it should work hopefully without bugs</p>
14:08 <@jrandom> ok, we can work you through ant to take care of things</p>
14:08 <+detonate> ok</p>
14:08 <+detonate> cool</p>
14:08 < cervantes2p> detonate: do what I did, take jrandom's code....strip out everything you don't need, crowbar in your own code and run the ant build script ;-)</p>
14:08 <@jrandom> heh</p>
14:09 <@smeghead> detonate: i know a thing or two about ant, yell if ya get stuck</p>
14:09 <+detonate> feel free to add it to your release</p>
14:09 <+detonate> if you know how to do that</p>
14:09 < MichElle> s/you don't need//</p>
14:09 < Ragnarok> addressbook has a very simple build script, if you want to take a look at that</p>
14:10 <+detonate> i need the section that precompiles jsps</p>
14:10 <+detonate> that's missing from mine</p>
14:10 <+detonate> although it does compile them, it just doesn't merge them, and the entry to test compile them isn't in build.xml</p>
14:10 <@jrandom> detonate: check out the precompilejsp targets in routerconsole, that'll get you started</p>
14:10 <+detonate> and i need to figure out where to put -source 1.3 etc in</p>
14:10 <@jrandom> (and the &lt;war&gt; task)</p>
14:11 <+detonate> yeah, we can sort things out later this evening</p>
14:11 <@jrandom> aye</p>
14:11 < cervantes> yup that's how I managed it...and I don't know ANY java or jsp ;-)</p>
14:11 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing more on 3) addressbook stuff, moving on to 4) bt stuff</p>
14:12 <@jrandom> duck/smeghead: wanna give us an update?</p>
14:12 <@duck> k</p>
14:12 <@duck> last week we spoke with Nolar from Azureus about fixing some compatibility problems</p>
14:12 <@duck> with the release of 0.1.8 as result</p>
14:12 <@duck> this week has been mostly about communication</p>
14:12 <@duck> with fellow developers, with forum admins and with users</p>
14:13 <+detonate> does anyone know if the aznet plugin can host torrents again?</p>
14:13 <@duck> the FAQ has been updated based on input from the forum, thanks for those who contributed</p>
14:13 <@duck> also there has been some miscommunication and confusion</p>
14:13 <@jrandom> detonate: word on the street is yes</p>
14:13 <@duck> like legions spork</p>
14:13 <+detonate> excellent</p>
14:13 <@duck> I believe that changing the name of it will prevent further problems there</p>
14:13 <@duck> .</p>
14:14 <@jrandom> r0xor duck</p>
14:14  * MichElle applauds duck</p>
14:14 < MichElle> duck: you work very hard</p>
14:14 < jnymo> yea, why not i2p-bt_extractor or some shit?</p>
14:15 <@jrandom> any word on the later 0.2 stuff, or is that to be addressed after 0.5.0.2/etc?</p>
14:15 <@smeghead> don't applaud yet, you don't know what we're naming it &gt;;-}</p>
14:15 <@jrandom> heh</p>
14:15  * jnymo claps</p>
14:15 <@duck> tell us!</p>
14:15 <@jrandom> i2p-flying-pony-torrent</p>
14:16 <+detonate> heh, are we hiding it now by changing the name?</p>
14:16 < MichElle> again with the ponies</p>
14:16 <@smeghead> it's top-secret for now, we don't want to get sued</p>
14:16 < jnymo> what a debocle</p>
14:17  * bla makes sign for MPAA: "Sue me, if you can..."</p>
14:17 <@smeghead> duck and i have agreed 0.2 will be the first version with the new name</p>
14:17 <+detonate> i2p-communism</p>
14:17 <@duck> released spring 2006</p>
14:17 <@jrandom> heh</p>
14:17 <@duck> .</p>
14:18 <@smeghead> based on my current workload and the fact that i'm moving this week, i don't expect to get any hacking done on 0.2 for a few days, i don't know what duck's near-term schedule is like</p>
14:18 <@duck> been doing 8 hours of C++ pointer fixing</p>
14:19 <@duck> so not much here either :)</p>
14:19 <@jrandom> 'k but something we can perhaps look forward to along side 0.6 (or 0.5.1 if we're lucky?)</p>
14:19 <@jrandom> yikes, fun fun fun</p>
14:19 <@duck> before 2.0 atleast</p>
14:19 <@smeghead> i'd estimate a month or so, just a wild guess, what do you think duck</p>
14:19 <@duck> yeah</p>
14:19 <@jrandom> cool</p>
14:19 <@duck> ballpark</p>
14:20 <@smeghead> the thing is we'd like to wait until the release of the official BT 4.0</p>
14:20 <@jrandom> its ok, we know how schedules go ;)</p>
14:20 <@smeghead> so we can sync 0.2 up-to-date with that</p>
14:20 < MichElle> duck has many things on his plate, indeed</p>
14:20 <@smeghead> 4.0 appears imminent</p>
14:20 <@jrandom> ah, really smeghead?  cool</p>
14:20 <@duck> smeghead: that is just the official excuse :)</p>
14:20 < MichElle> but he is a hard worker</p>
14:21 <@duck> I am for 5) ???</p>
14:21 <@jrandom> almost there... </p>
14:21 <@jrandom> legion: any updates on your bt client?  progress, etc?</p>
14:21 <@smeghead> source code?</p>
14:22 <@smeghead> (in a zip, not an .exe)</p>
14:22 < cervantes> so the next wave of releases then</p>
14:22 <@jrandom> hmm, legion seems to be idle, ok perhaps we can get an update later</p>
14:22 < cervantes2p> damn huge lag</p>
14:23 <@jrandom> so, movin' on over to 5) ???</p>
14:23 < cervantes> *ahem* w00t</p>
14:23 <@jrandom> cervantes2p: nah, you're just slow ;)</p>
14:23 <@jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything to bring up?</p>
14:23 < cervantes2p> I said those things like 5 minutes ago</p>
14:23 <+ugha2p> jrandom: The mailing list footer still uses the i2p.dnsalias.net address. Perhaps you should update it to reflect dev.i2p.net? :)</p>
14:23  * cervantes2p feeds his router's hamster</p>
14:24 <@jrandom> ah, yeah, prolly ugha2p </p>
14:24  * jrandom has some sysadmin work i've been avoiding for a while (like, oh, moving things to the new srever...)</p>
14:24 < MichElle> I have a concern</p>
14:24 < MichElle> regarding transparency</p>
14:24 <@jrandom> sup MichElle?</p>
14:25 < MichElle> for purposes of full transparency, I will declare here that identiguy has suggested jrandom could in fact be employed by the NSA</p>
14:25 <+detonate> oh, i've noticed 190 routers, how close are we to the thread limit right now?</p>
14:25  * jnymo wonders about other help people can do</p>
14:25 < jnymo> (still looking into the php thing, duck ;)</p>
14:25 <@jrandom> heh MichElle</p>
14:25 < MichElle> his 'convenient' ability to work 24/7 on i2p is quite suspicious, indeed</p>
14:25 < MichElle> anyway</p>
14:25 < MichElle> that's all I wanted to say</p>
14:25 < MichElle> keep your eyes on jrandom</p>
14:26 < MichElle> his gentle and warm facade may be just that.</p>
14:26 <+ugha2p> detonate: There are no theoretical thread limits, it will just consume all available resources until it crashes. :)</p>
14:26 < jnymo> facade</p>
14:26 <@jrandom> detonate: some OSes/ulimits may throttle @ 256, but win98 is already past the 100 TCP connections limit anyway</p>
14:26 < cervantes2p> I can give a quick update on the firefox plugin. The I2P Mail notifier is working now, as is the news reader and basic router controls. I'm busy with tediously building configuration screens now ( http://freshcoffee.i2p/fire2pe_i2pmail_prefs.jpg )</p>
14:27 < jnymo> MichElle, if the source code is sound, then who cares?</p>
14:27 <+detonate> oh, is the firefox plugin released?</p>
14:27 < MichElle> jnymo: it ruins the mood a little</p>
14:27 < cervantes2p> and I want to implement a downloader/install service that ties into smeghead's new updater verifier before I release</p>
14:27 < ddd> hi channel</p>
14:28 <+detonate> ok</p>
14:28 <@jrandom> w0ah! kickass cervantes2p </p>
14:28 <@jrandom> it looks really nice</p>
14:28 <+detonate> hi ddd</p>
14:28 < cervantes2p> but getting close now...probably another couple of weeks...</p>
14:28 < MichElle> sort of like how running windows would still not be cool, even if microsoft open-sourced it</p>
14:28 <+detonate> that plugin looks cool</p>
14:28 < MichElle> back to the meeting, though ...</p>
14:28 <@smeghead> TrustedUpdate may be done this week hopefully, before i move</p>
14:28 <@jrandom> cool</p>
14:29 < ddd> ?</p>
14:29 < ddd> is i2p the only anonymous chat?</p>
14:29 <@jrandom> hi ddd .  weekly dev meeting going on</p>
14:30 < cervantes2p> 'lo ddd, we're just finishing a meeting...stick around we'll be done in a couple of minutes</p>
14:30 < ddd> are there other projects like i2p?</p>
14:30 <@smeghead> ddd: type /list then take your pick</p>
14:30 < ddd> ok</p>
14:30 < ddd> no i mean on other networks</p>
14:30 <@jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything to bring up for 5) ???</p>
14:30 <@smeghead> ddd: ask in #i2p-chat</p>
14:30 < ddd> ok i let you guys finish</p>
14:30 <+detonate> has anyone successfully run i2p in openbsd yet?</p>
14:31 <@jrandom> ddd: http://www.i2p.net/how_networkcomparisons</p>
14:31 < ddd> ok</p>
14:31 <+detonate> i was thinking of starting that fiasco up again</p>
14:31 <@jrandom> detonate: dunno</p>
14:31 < jnymo> oh yea.. who was doing the bsd i2p distro, and which bsd was it?</p>
14:31 <@jrandom> heh cool detonate, let us know how it goes</p>
14:31 <@jrandom> jnymo: lioux packaged 'er up for fbsd</p>
14:32 <@smeghead> i2p would never ship with openbsd :)</p>
14:32 <+detonate> sure</p>
14:32 < jnymo> woord..  wasn't someone going to do a i2p oriented distro?</p>
14:32 <+detonate> yeah, there's a port in freebsd now</p>
14:32 <+detonate> it's scary</p>
14:32 <+detonate> heh, someone wanted to have a knoppix cd that ran i2p</p>
14:32 <@jrandom> jnymo: after i2p is rock solid, it'd be worthwhile to explore packaging on distros/microdistros, yeah</p>
14:32 <+detonate> who knows why</p>
14:33 <@smeghead> jnymo: i remember that, i think it was going to be a knoppix/i2p, can't recall who was talking about it</p>
14:33 <@jrandom> detonate: netcafe</p>
14:33 <+detonate> ah</p>
14:34 <@jrandom> ok, anything else for the meeting?</p>
14:34 < MichElle> what the fuck is an i2p 'oriented' distro</p>
14:34 < MichElle> tor, i2p, and freenet ?</p>
14:34 < MichElle> there is no purpose</p>
14:34 < MichElle> the bandwidth requirements cancel the programmes out</p>
14:34 < MichElle> is jrandom theo de raadt ?</p>
14:34 < cervantes> a slightly camp distribution</p>
14:34 < jnymo> a completely anonymized distro</p>
14:35 < cervantes2p> jrandom: I guess not :)</p>
14:35 < MichElle> jrandom: nothing</p>
14:35  * jrandom winds up</p>
14:35  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
