<mids>	After having worked for IIP for more than I year now, I have decided to</p>
	  resign as IIP developer.</p>
<LeerokLacerta> Awww.</p>
<mids>	It has been fun and an educative experience</p>
<mids>	but it is time to move on, refresh the spirit and shuffle the cards.</p>
<Rain>	Will you still be online/around?</p>

<hezekiah>	(And in case anyone doubted, Hezekiah == Ehud.)</p>
<hifi>	i never used frucking trent and don't know what mids did . i only troll .</p>

<hezekiah>	Ugh</p>
<hezekiah>	Item number 3?</p>
<hezekiah>	(If we're all done sobbing yet ...)</p>
<hifi>	and i never was pingouted in my life . I am the most disciplined user of</p>

<luckypunk>	heh</p>
<luckypunk>	Ok everyone!  Shhh.  Back on track!</p>
<hifi>	BUT I CRY that MIDS GO !!!</p>
<hifi>	ok</p>
<hifi>	.</p>
<luckypunk>	IIP development.  Whats the current status of that code snapshot</p>
	  release?</p>
<luckypunk>	That was supposed to happen today?</p>
<hezekiah>	Well, unless UserX has an objection to the tarball I made,</p>
	  it's done.</p>
<luckypunk>	Ok.  Post it on the wiki?</p>
<hezekiah>	UserX? Were there any problems with the tarball?</p>
<UserX> no problems with the tarball</p>
<luckypunk>	Yes, but are there any windows compilations?</p>
<hezekiah>	OK1</p>
<hezekiah>	http://invisiblenet.net/hezekiah</p>
<hezekiah>	Get your tarballs there!</p>
<UserX> there hasn't been a windows compilation on the windows version yet</p>
<luckypunk>	hm</p>
<LeerokLacerta> "tarballs" sound like some sort of food...</p>
*	luckypunk will try and make one.</p>
---	hezekiah has changed the topic to: IIP Meeting - logfiles:</p>
	  http://wiki.invisiblenet.net/?Meetings - http://www.invisiblenet.net/research/</p>
- tarballs of the 'unstable' development release are at</p>
	  http://invisiblenet.net/hezekiah | We love you mids!</p>
<luckypunk>	They are.  For GCC.</p>
<luckypunk>	lol</p>
<Rain>	Sticky food.</p>
<hezekiah>	There is one 'documented bug'.</p>
<nop>	I can compile a win32 version if you'd like</p>
<Rain>	So, could you give a quick describtion of what is new in this release?</p>
<hezekiah>	If you run isproxy, and it fails to bind the port, then it will</p>
	  /not/ abort. It will just sit there wasting memory.</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: That's too much for me to handle (not to mention I don't</p>
	  even _know_ all the differences).</p>
<Ambience>	this one I assume: iip-1.2-dev1.tar.bz2    01-Jul-2003 01:45</p>
	  292k  tar archive ?</p>
<hezekiah>	UserX could give a much better description</p>
<hezekiah>	UserX?</p>
<nop>	hezekiah/UserX can we get a changelog of the differences by chance</p>
<nop>	that may be a day before that gets done</p>
<hezekiah>	Ambience: Yup! Or the Gziped one. There the same tarball.</p>
<nop>	because there are a log of changes</p>
<Rain>	Oh, and has the expired IIP signing-key been replaced?</p>
<Ambience>	hezekiah: ok</p>
<hezekiah>	nop: I joined IIP after the development branch was already in</p>
	  progress.</p>
-->	Ehud (~hezekiah@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: No. I had to use my GPG key.</p>
<nop>	no one has tested the compile of this dev branch in win32 have they?</p>
<luckypunk>	Hey, is this src is CVS?</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: I couldn't contact anyone who had the IIP release key.</p>
<hezekiah>	luckypunk: Yes.</p>
*	luckypunk has, but his system didn't work for it.</p>
<Rain>	hezekiah: Ok, roger.</p>
<UserX> changes: multi-threading,  bignum support via openSSL or GMP, numerous</p>
	  inmprovements to the memory management system</p>
<hezekiah>	luckypunk: Right now that tarball is a copy of what you get when</p>
	  you check out the hezekiah-dev branch from CVS and run 'make dist-bzip2'.</p>
<luckypunk>	Gah!  I hate windows.</p>
<Rain>	UserX: niceties ;)</p>
<hezekiah>	And of course there are other internal changes that only the</p>
	  developers see. :)</p>
<qriff> just as a question for the qurious... what defines the holder for "Trent"...</p>
<hezekiah>	One simple thing is that now that BigNum is implemented using</p>
	  either GMP or SSL, login is a LOT faster.</p>
<Rain>	May i mention a IIP quirk i noticed earlier today?</p>
*	luckypunk guesses its a yes.</p>
<hifi>	at wiki search button is absent . only window to type in but nowhere to</p>
	  click lol .</p>
<luckypunk>	hit enter.</p>
<qriff> and what about channel/nick expiration...</p>
---	Ehud is now known as logger</p>
<qriff> registration that is...</p>
<Rain>	Ok, it seems to me like you cannot start isproxy from a /path/to/isproxy</p>
	  command, but intead have to do a cd /path/to and then do a ./isproxy</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: Let me guess ... you get a configuration screen or a request</p>
	  for entropy, right?</p>
*	jrand0m has a feeling this will be a very.long.meeting</p>
<Rain>	Is that intentional, or just some quirk of my local system?</p>
<Rain>	hezekiah: yes.</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: You need to make a .iip subdirectory in your home directory.</p>
<Rain>	It claims that the conf-file is not found.</p>
<Rain>	with my .conf file?</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: If no such directory exists, isproxy will always look for</p>
	  the config files in the current directory</p>
-->	AmishOne (amishone@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<Rain>	Ahh. Of course.</p>
<hezekiah>	OK ...</p>
<hezekiah>	nop? Was there anything else for item 3?</p>
<nop>	have we tested it for win32</p>
<nop>	compile wise</p>
<hezekiah>	I haven't.</p>
<nop>	UserX: ?</p>
<UserX> no</p>
<nop>	I will test it this week then</p>
<hezekiah>	luckypunk, tried doing hezekiah-dev recently and complained for</p>
	  compile errors.</p>
<nop>	that's key to maintain portability</p>
<hezekiah>	I suspect there might be problems.</p>
*	luckypunk tried, it balked.</p>
<hezekiah>	Yup. There are problems.</p>
<Ambience>	I'll have to leave for the more dominant one is ordering me to</p>
	  and I have no choice here. So I'll be off to bed, but will be logging #iip-dev</p>
	  for future reference.</p>
<Ambience>	see ya guys!</p>
<lonelynerd>	later</p>
<qriff> bye</p>
<hezekiah>	Bye, Ambience. :)</p>
<luckypunk>	i'll be back.</p>
<Ambience>	&lt;--gone (log on)</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	this topic is done</p>
<nop>	next on agenda</p>
<nop>	what's 4?</p>
<hezekiah>	4) IIP development restructuring proposal</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	we had a meeting about a discussion and proposal brought to us by jrand0m</p>
	  for the future development</p>
<nop>	and as well</p>
<nop>	I have had a lot of privmessages directed at me</p>
<nop>	for requests to focus on an arbitrary framework, instead of IRC specific</p>
<nop>	aka a framework that supports IRC + a whole lot more</p>
<nop>	so the want is obviously there</p>
<nop>	and the developers definitely want to go there as well</p>
<hezekiah>	Amen!</p>
<nop>	the question of how to go about doing it</p>
<nop>	and how to make the most productive use of our developers</p>
<nop>	is up in the air</p>
<ChZEROHag>	XML</p>
<mids>	is his framework site available to everybody?</p>
<nop>	this isn't specifically about language</p>
<ChZEROHag>	create a communications protocol</p>
<nop>	ok, please let me finish</p>
<ChZEROHag>	I've started on that somewhere...</p>
<nop>	then we can comment</p>
<ChZEROHag>	My apologies</p>
<ChZEROHag>	I'm a bit in and out at the moment</p>
<nop>	ok,</p>
<nop>	no prob</p>
<nop>	We are at a stage where there is discussion of an arbitrary communications</p>
	  protocol</p>
<nop>	specifically for anonymous and secure communication</p>
<nop>	at this point jrand0m, any chance we can post the logs of #iip-future</p>
	  meeting</p>
<jrand0m>	sure</p>
<jrand0m>	perhaps those zips I sent you so people don't have to struggle</p>
	  through freenet for the other pages too</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	hold</p>
<nop>	please</p>
<jrand0m>	(btw, the logs were unedited, so expect the usual occational banter)</p>
<hezekiah>	lol. Yup! You'll get to see exactly how much I DON'T know about</p>
	  p2p networks! lol</p>
<jrand0m>	heh</p>
<hezekiah>	(And they'll probably have my conspiracy theories about nop</p>
	  too! So be sure to read the logs! ;-) )</p>
<--	logger has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<hezekiah>	Ugh</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<Neo>	the logs will be a lot to read. can someone summarizze for the meeting</p>
	  what was covered and some key points of all this?</p>
<nop>	http://office.invisiblenet.net/iip_future.zip</p>
<nop>	and</p>
<hezekiah>	At this point, the 'stable' release is being more unstable than</p>
	  the 'unstable' one!! Urg.</p>
<nop>	http://office.invisiblenet.net/meetingPrepnotes.zip</p>
<nop>	http://office.invisiblenet.net/jrand0mnetwork_protocol.txt</p>
<jrand0m>	meetingPrepnotes.zip is a small doc that summarizes the meeting,</p>
	  and the meeting was basically "ok, any thoughts?".</p>
<--	Delly has quit (EOF From client)</p>
<jrand0m>	essentially, the proposal is to get going on a generic secure</p>
	  anonymous message based system, and run iip on top of that</p>
<mids>	is there a zip with anonCommFramework too?</p>
<nop>	I didn't see that</p>
<nop>	jrand0m can you zip and send I'll post to site</p>
<jrand0m>	sure, h/o</p>
<--	Phiberoptika has quit (* ciaito mua mua *)</p>
<Neo>	what is anonCommFramework?</p>
<jrand0m>	uber-quick summary of the meeting in iip_future.zip is "ok,</p>
	  here's the proposal, any comments?" and comments were basically "ok, can IIP work</p>
	  as planned on this?</p>
<jrand0m>	if you're on freenet, anonCommFramework is at</p>
	  SSK@MQNd5lT-X5wHA4vONvtVadi6q1IPAgM/anonCommFramework/2//</p>
*	jrand0m is sending nop a zip of that momentarily</p>
<Rain>	Did you discuss support for PGP-based nyms?</p>
<nop>	ah hem, this is early discussions</p>
<--	ChZEROHag has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<jrand0m>	no, endpoints in the framework are not nym based, they're idents</p>
<Rain>	Right. So nyms an higher level.</p>
<Rain>	are</p>
<jrand0m>	(and for lots of reasons, they shouldn't be long term idents</p>
	  like nyms)</p>
<jrand0m>	yes</p>
<Rain>	I was just thinking of something like trent with PGP signarute auth.</p>
<mids>	trent is central</p>
<mids>	central=bad</p>
-->	logger (~hezekiah@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<jrand0m>	briefly, anonCommFramework is a meta-network.  a generic set</p>
	  of protocols &amp; structures that an anonymous communication network could use to</p>
	  interoperate to provide militant grade anonymity</p>
<wilde> what's the one sentence explanation of your ideas on network topology?</p>
-->	ChZEROHag (~hag@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<ChZEROHag>	that was fun</p>
-->	Delly (dedede@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<Rain>	mids: Yea. I meant similar services.</p>
<lonelynerd>	what about having to pay with hashcash to send data? couldn't</p>
	  that help against flooding?</p>
<jrand0m>	wilde&gt; heterogeneous.  no one answer solves all problems.</p>
	  interoperate, balancing latency, bandwidth, anonymity, and reliability to provide</p>
	  the user's needs</p>
<Delly> still in 4) ?</p>
<hezekiah>	Delly: Yup</p>
<Delly> thx</p>
<ChZEROHag>	I think when the ircd is removed from the equation, we'll have</p>
	  far better options than (hash|think|real)cash</p>
<nop>	jrand0m: any luck sending</p>
<nop>	;)</p>
<jrand0m>	uploading to hush now.</p>
<jrand0m>	ChZEROHag&gt; anonCommFramework has built in support for providing</p>
	  network use authorization credentials</p>
<Rain>	There has been a lot of talk of IIP-Freenet interoparability. Will that</p>
	  fit into the framework, or are we talking application-level again?</p>
<ChZEROHag>	come again?</p>
<jrand0m>	app level</p>
<jrand0m>	what we're discussing is splitting iip into two parts - the irc</p>
	  part, and the message based secure anonymous network</p>
<wilde> one solution could be:</p>
<Rain>	jrand0m: k.</p>
<wilde> Application &lt;-&gt; SOCKS5 Proxy Interface &lt;-&gt; Onion Wrapper &lt;-&gt; Onion Router</p>
	  1 <-> ... &lt;-&gt; Onion Router N &lt;-&gt; Exit Relay &lt;-&gt; Public Server</p>
<jrand0m>	building a DHT on top of the message layer should be fairly easy</p>
<hezekiah>	DHT?</p>
<jrand0m>	distributed hash table</p>
<jrand0m>	(ala freenet)</p>
<nop>	ok, jrand0m let me clarify</p>
<ChZEROHag>	wilde: I think the plan is to design it such that the 'public</p>
	  server' could be removed from the equation at some point</p>
<nop>	are we talking about splitting irc, or merging to focus on anonymity</p>
	  framework</p>
<jrand0m>	well, given unlimited # of developers, splitting and doing both</p>
	  (well, 3 things ;) in parallel.</p>
<nop>	what I mean is that the irc part is application layer</p>
<jrand0m>	given reality, there's prolly only enough dev time to get the</p>
	  comm system running first, then iip on top</p>
<jrand0m>	right exactly</p>
<nop>	and since we have a somewhat viable network working with IIP</p>
<jrand0m>	irc is just another app running on it</p>
<nop>	then the idea should be</p>
<nop>	is to have developers start focusing on framework aspects</p>
<wilde> ChZEROHag: ok, what I suggested is an anonymizing layer for regular</p>
	  internet traffic, not a seperate network</p>
<hezekiah>	(This could get fun.)</p>
<nop>	wilde there are weaknesses to that</p>
<nop>	just to let you know</p>
<nop>	aka the clear text on the outer ends</p>
<--	AmishOne has quit (EOF From client)</p>
<wilde> nop: yes, so all connections should be encrypted to the ends</p>
<nop>	we have an effort as well to have anonymous web browsing possible with</p>
	  this network</p>
<jrand0m>	yes.  it must be able to operate without ever leaving the mixnet</p>
<nop>	but it is not as real time direct as your proposal wilde</p>
<nop>	it uses some time delay tactics</p>
<nop>	with caching etc</p>
<nop>	timing attacks are a serious threat to anonymity</p>
<hifi>	I WANT ANONYMISER BASED on IIP !! I DON"t TRUST OTHER ANONYSERS THEY ARE</p>
	  FBI TRAPs !!</p>
<mids>	http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/anonCommFramework/</p>
<nop>	hifi, this isn't changing IIP, this is moving us forward</p>
<nop>	thanks mids</p>
<jrand0m>	heh word mids, my moz is hanging</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<wilde> although independant mixnets are cool, the real killer apps will probably</p>
	  be general ip traffic anonymizers</p>
<nop>	wilde, they are myths</p>
<wilde> killer apps?</p>
<nop>	no</p>
<--	thetower has quit (EOF From client)</p>
<jrand0m>	wilde&gt; that could be a service built on top of the comm layer</p>
<nop>	general ip traffic anonymizers</p>
<wilde> or ip traffic anonymizers?</p>
<nop>	so far they don't exist</p>
<nop>	they exist in papers only</p>
-->	thetower (none@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<jrand0m>	if you build an anonymizing service on top of the comm layer,</p>
	  however, your outbound routers will get shut down quickly</p>
<thetower>	Haha, I just noticed I wasn't port forwarding.</p>
<thetower>	Oop, sorry, wrong chan</p>
<wilde> nop: what about the ZKS system?</p>
<nop>	is it still around?</p>
<nop>	and working</p>
<wilde> nope, bad business</p>
<wilde> few people paid</p>
<wilde> but the framework seemed to work, but all nodes were ZKS:s paid relays</p>
<nop>	wilde but they were internal and it wasn't complete</p>
<nop>	it still had certain vulnerabilities</p>
<nop>	it was a start</p>
<nop>	I met Ian Goldberg at CodeCon 2k2, and he himself admitted it was incomplete</p>
	  to what he desired</p>
<wilde> yes, everything has vulnerabilities, we just raise the cost of tracing</p>
	  dramatically</p>
<jrand0m>	right, after the mixnet is up and running, i'd like to see wilde</p>
	  offer generic outbound proxy services.	that'd be cool</p>
<jrand0m>	(sincerely)</p>
<nop>	jrand0m: but again the ultimate would be using that magic mirror concept</p>
	  for optimum protection</p>
<ChZEROHag>	Probably the hardest option, but wouldn't freenet be a good</p>
	  framework to build from?</p>
<nop>	wilde, maybe you and I can discuss this in another forum at some point</p>
<jrand0m>	but in any case, the network must be built first</p>
<ChZEROHag>	Or is that not what we're discussing?</p>
<jrand0m>	ChZEROHag&gt; no.</p>
<jrand0m>	freenet doesn't provide hard anonymity</p>
<ChZEROHag>	aah</p>
<ChZEROHag>	I should try paying attention</p>
<nop>	ok, moving forward</p>
<nop>	UserX you still here</p>
<wilde> nop: yes, if you have decided on topology there is no need to discuss</p>
	  this in public</p>
<UserX> I'm still here</p>
<nop>	well it's application layer, so that comes after net design etc</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	where did we leave off at #iip-future meeting</p>
<--	hezekiah has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<nop>	let's start there</p>
---	logger is now known as Ehud</p>
*	nop is catching up on the meeting logs</p>
<jrand0m>	[04:31] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I think we're back to your question.	can /</p>
	  should the irc functionality move forward as its going or move towards this mixnet.</p>
	  there are significant benefits to move towards the mixnet, but some aspects of</p>
	  the irc side seem to require some redesign to operate on it.</p>
<jrand0m>	[04:31] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the right way for the irc development to go is</p>
	  not for me to say</p>
<Ehud>	Basically, UserX had some thinking to do about wether IIP could run</p>
	  satisfactorily on the mixnet.</p>
<mids>	nite all</p>
<--	mids (mids@anon.iip) has left #iip-dev (mids)</p>
<ChZEROHag>	Would it not be an idea to create a replacement irc in parallel</p>
	  with a mixnet?</p>
<ChZEROHag>	After all it's going to be damn hard to use a normal ircd</p>
<jrand0m>	ChZEROHag&gt; given infinite # devs, yes</p>
<nop>	ok ChZEROHag silence please :)</p>
<ChZEROHag>	Assume infinite devs</p>
<ChZEROHag>	Oh is this not a question bit?</p>
-->	hezekiah (hezekiah@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<nop>	not yet</p>
<UserX> Unfortuantlely I haven't had time to seriously sit down and think about</p>
	  how your proposal would fit in with IIP</p>
<ChZEROHag>	oh</p>
<ChZEROHag>	oops</p>
<nop>	just want to get into the discussion</p>
<nop>	well</p>
<jrand0m>	UserX&gt; think of the mixnet as a socket</p>
<nop>	let me suggest something</p>
<nop>	do we agree that our goal is not just IRC ?</p>
<lonelynerd>	well</p>
<Delly> it's a great idea sure</p>
<hezekiah>	nop: Beyond all doubts, I agree that the goal is an anonymous</p>
	  network.</p>
<lonelynerd>	doing something traffic-intensive would have the potential to</p>
	  ruin the whole project</p>
<hezekiah>	nop: IRC is just a starting point.</p>
<nop>	ok, well what we should look at is this</p>
<jrand0m>	NOT doing something traffic intensive has the potential to get</p>
	  us to overlook problems :)</p>
<nop>	instead of saying IIP doesn't fit</p>
<nop>	or it does fit</p>
<nop>	let's look at what modifications need to be made for irc to fit with this</p>
	  mixnet, whether it's a mod to the mixnet itself</p>
<lonelynerd>	jrand0m: hmm</p>
<nop>	for instance</p>
<nop>	UserX has a vision of using channels as endpoints</p>
<nop>	Jrand0m calls them idents</p>
<nop>	are they having subtle differences</p>
<nop>	or are they largely different</p>
<jrand0m>	there's substance to those differences.</p>
<nop>	can we review that</p>
<nop>	on both sides</p>
<nop>	from jrand0m and UserX</p>
<--	hezekiah has quit (EOF From client)</p>
<nop>	actually</p>
<nop>	read the log</p>
<nop>	nevermind</p>
<jrand0m>	;)</p>
-->	hezekiah (hezekiah@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<jrand0m>	the hesitancy I have w/ sending messages to a channel ident and</p>
	  having that channel redistribute it to members is that the channel gets plaintext</p>
<nop>	how does it get plaintext?</p>
<jrand0m>	instead, I'd suggest having a channel contain just the channel info</p>
	  (modes, users, topic, etc)</p>
<jrand0m>	the channel is just an application running on one (well, 3+)</p>
	  routers listening to one (well, 3+) identities.  when you /msg a channel, you</p>
	  send a message to that identity (application).	it then resends it out to the N</p>
	  users in the channel, encrypted to each</p>
<nop>	well</p>
<nop>	I had a proposal for that</p>
<nop>	that would have the channel not contain plaintext</p>
<nop>	directly</p>
<jrand0m>	at least, without adding a channel key (which would be managed</p>
	  by the channel application itself, which defeats the point)</p>
<nop>	well</p>
<nop>	we were having channel keys</p>
<nop>	for private channels</p>
<nop>	and pub channels are public anyway</p>
<jrand0m>	right.	there may be ways around it.  y'all know more about irc</p>
	  than I do.  there are other ways that don't require going this route though</p>
<nop>	see the neat thing with message channels is this</p>
<nop>	you scale slightly better than trying to find all idents to send to directly</p>
<--	luckypunk has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
-->	dd0c (dd0c@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<jrand0m>	I'm not sure you scale better, but you do redistribute the load</p>
<jrand0m>	(we can find idents via O(log(n)))</p>
-->	sahara (~sahara@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<jrand0m>	but thats neither here nor there, this is application layer</p>
	  design ;)</p>
<nop>	right</p>
<jrand0m>	all we need to do, imho, is find some workable ways that *could*</p>
	  operate on the comm layer and then leave it to the wayside until we get there</p>
<UserX> jrand0m: messages sent to channels are encrypted with a channel key that</p>
	  is different to the channel's identity. a channel server can't decrypt a message</p>
	  unless it has come across the key by othermeans</p>
<sahara>	did I miss the meeting?</p>
<jrand0m>	you've got some ways that could work, it sounds like, right?</p>
<jrand0m>	UserX&gt; how does a user joining a channel get the key?</p>
<hezekiah>	sahara: Nope. You're right in the middle of it! :)</p>
<nop>	it's a key exchange</p>
<jrand0m>	with whom nop?</p>
<jrand0m>	brand new user joining #anonymous, and the app containing the</p>
	  list of users on #anonymous doesn't have the key (As userx said)</p>
<jrand0m>	(all I'm saying is there's a way to get all the functionality</p>
	  and still avoid having a channel key)</p>
<UserX> jrand0m: with public channels it is derived from the channel name. with</p>
	  private channels the user either creates one or a someone gives them the keys to</p>
	  the channel</p>
<jrand0m>	'k, cool</p>
<jrand0m>	so apps managing public channels can read the plaintext (by</p>
	  deriving from the channel name)</p>
<jrand0m>	(which is prolly fine)</p>
<nop>	right</p>
<wilde> jrand0m: if the apps encrypt the plaintext to each recepient, will it</p>
	  scale well?</p>
<jrand0m>	yes wilde, perhaps better (depending on the algorithm used to</p>
	  nominate channel managers)</p>
<jrand0m>	(though it will potentially have a nonserialized delivery)</p>
<jrand0m>	((though i think thats the case with normal irc anyway))</p>
<--	thecrypto has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
<jrand0m>	but, getting back on to the question -</p>
<jrand0m>	nop, what do we hope to have decided by the end of the discussion</p>
	  of #4?</p>
<--	Neo has quit (Ping timeout)</p>
-->	d (~sahara@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev</p>
<nop>	well</p>
<--	sahara has quit (EOF From client)</p>
<hifi>	simple site , problem is i am tech blond but want good things lol</p>
<nop>	I was hoping that we could re-organize, but this is gonna be a discussion</p>
	  for later</p>
<hifi>	sorry OOPS</p>
<nop>	UserX</p>
<--	d has quit (Client exiting)</p>
<nop>	how long will you need to think about certain aspects, and maybe doc them</p>
	  up as a concern list</p>
<UserX> hard to say. maybe a week</p>
<nop>	what I'm thinking jrand0m is that a lot of this needs sorting out, rather</p>
	  than just plowing into it, or we'll end up at the beginning with nothing to show</p>
<nop>	so let's push a week into this</p>
<nop>	and see what concerns are coming into play</p>
<nop>	because again</p>
<nop>	we want an adaptable mixnet</p>
<nop>	any application should be able to survive</p>
<jrand0m>	absolutely</p>
<jrand0m>	thats the point of the anon comm framework</p>
<--	wilde has quit ()</p>
<nop>	ok, so let's put this off a week, and focus on some realistic proposals</p>
	  that can fit all of our needs</p>
<jrand0m>	you say "send message M to location L" and it magically, securely,</p>
	  anonymously gets delivered</p>
<nop>	but magic is one thing</p>
<nop>	science is another</p>
<nop>	of course you know that :)</p>
<jrand0m>	the magic is from the app level's perspective ;)</p>
<nop>	yes</p>
<nop>	understood</p>
<jrand0m>	the science is in that 15 page anonCommFramework/2// ;)</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<hezekiah>	lol</p>
<nop>	UserX, if you can get that in a week that would be helpful</p>
<nop>	?</p>
<jrand0m>	I'll aim at revamping the docs &amp; getting comm layer network design</p>
	  ready for then so we can hit the ground running</p>
<nop>	well</p>
<nop>	we haven't agreed on certain aspects</p>
<nop>	I think that still should be hashed out</p>
<jrand0m>	what, in the network layer, haven't we agreed on?</p>
<nop>	personally I agree that maybe you post your anonCommFramework on iip-dev</p>
<nop>	and have it reviewed and commented</p>
*	jrand0m isn't on iip-dev</p>
<Rain>	So, meeting again next tuesday, same bat-time, same bat-channel?</p>
<nop>	what haven't we agreed on is whether it can support all applications</p>
<hezekiah>	jrand0m: Just post to iip-dev@invisiblenet.net .</p>
<hezekiah>	Rain: We are on item #4. There are still other items to go. :)</p>
<jrand0m>	its ~800k.  if someone could post the URL to mids' mirror that'd</p>
	  be cool</p>
<Delly> argh</p>
<Delly> re</p>
<Delly> about services, i think if IIP become more easier and friendly, we will see</p>
	  more users and more nodes. it's why i'm making script for mIRC user, one is a Trent</p>
	  script, allowing to use Trent and Anonymail with the mouse, the other is a script</p>
	  allowing to transfer file over iip, staying anonymous (using uuencoding). The</p>
	  "protocol" used is easy and could be done for lot's irc clients with scripting</p>
	  support. And so everybody could transfer little files, even between di</p>
<jrand0m>	nop&gt; I'm 100% certain it can support all applications.</p>
<Rain>	hezekiah: Right. My missunderstanding.</p>
<jrand0m>	this layer has been used for over a decade in hundreds of industries</p>
<Delly> was my thought of the day</p>
<nop>	well then where do we not agree</p>
<nop>	if Irc is an issue, then how is it adaptable?</p>
<jrand0m>	it isn't an issue</p>
<jrand0m>	y'all just don't understand the layer's abstraction ;)</p>
<lonelynerd>	Delly: i have a perl script that allows one to use ssh/telnet/etc</p>
	  over irc</p>
<jrand0m>	(really, think of it as a socket)</p>
<Delly> lonelynerd, the goal was just to enhance mirc</p>
<Delly> for iip network</p>
<lonelynerd>	Delly: yeah, but if you use base64, i think it's compatible with</p>
	  this one</p>
<Delly> could be possible tu use it</p>
<jrand0m>	ok, we ready for #5 yet?</p>
<hezekiah>	nop?</p>

---	hezekiah_ is now known as hezekiah</p>
<nop>	before I agree to go to 5</p>
<nop>	the problem I'm seeing is</p>
<nop>	UserX has a voice</p>
<nop>	as well</p>
---	Trent@anon.iip gives channel operator status to hezekiah</p>
<jrand0m>	of course</p>
<nop>	and if he sees logistical problems</p>
<nop>	I believe they should be heard</p>
<nop>	so you can't just say, hey it's gonna work</p>
<nop>	it has to be "solidly" agreed on both ends</p>
<nop>	aka he needs convincing</p>
<jrand0m>	right, but I'm not going to sit on my thumbs waiting for him</p>
	  to doc them up.  if he does come up with some problems in a week, fantastic,</p>
	  and we'll revise accordingly</p>
<nop>	or he needs to convine you</p>
<nop>	but the idea is this</p>
<nop>	what I'm trying to propose with this</p>
<nop>	is to reorganize our dev team to get on your bandwagon</p>
<nop>	with that</p>
<nop>	it would put our energy in working on the network design</p>
<nop>	that's the idea</p>
<nop>	thus helping all of us get somewhere specific</p>
<nop>	I'm not trying to slow down</p>
<jrand0m>	right, i don't expect to have a V1.0 final protocol spec next week.</p>
	  last night I downloaded about 50 new articles off citeseer to do some more research</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	so can we post your proposal to iip-dev</p>
<nop>	and get some review</p>
<jrand0m>	coo'</p>
<nop>	also I advise on your own to propose it on cryptography@metzdowd.com</p>
<nop>	which will get some serious review</p>
<jrand0m>	sounds good</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	UserX, you there</p>
<UserX> i'm here</p>
<nop>	ok, so jrand0m will work on protocol spec, and can I assume you'll come</p>
	  up with a concerns list or some additives to the protocol?</p>
<UserX> yes</p>
<nop>	ok, let's resume this in a week</p>
<nop>	what was 5?</p>
<nop>	sorry If I'm being a pain</p>
<nop>	just want to organize it</p>
<nop>	to make sure we're all on same page</p>
<jrand0m>	recruiting for services...?</p>
<hezekiah>	5) Recruiting for services to aid with IIP</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
<nop>	yes</p>
<nop>	since mids departure</p>
<nop>	and cohesions return</p>
<nop>	we are possibly looking for others to contribute to IIP in some aspect</p>
<nop>	this does not mean you have to be a hardcore core developer</p>
<nop>	but additives like maybe a web maintainer would be good,</p>
<nop>	some PR would be good</p>
<hezekiah>	luckypunk volunteered to manage the website.</p>
<hezekiah>	&lt;luckypunk&gt; I wanna help/take over the IIP website.</p>
<hezekiah>	&lt;luckypunk&gt; :D</p>
<nop>	and if more people would like to hop on with the upcoming project that</p>
	  jrand0m is proposing</p>
<jrand0m>	wikked</p>
<nop>	even if you just want to review the protocol</p>
<nop>	that is more than enough help</p>
<nop>	the reality is this</p>
<nop>	we have a lot of developers with real time jobs</p>
<nop>	and it is consuming them at the moment</p>
<nop>	and any additional help is wanted</p>
<nop>	since this is a huge endeavor</p>
<nop>	to take IIP to where it needs to be</p>
<nop>	aka InvisibleNet at some point</p>
<nop>	real life jobs ;)</p>
<nop>	anyway</p>
<nop>	the idea is</p>
<nop>	it would be cool if people would love to add to this project in some ways</p>
<nop>	using their skills, and I know their are some programmers out there</p>
<nop>	and a few that have some spare tiem</p>
<nop>	time</p>
<nop>	luckypunk's reliability will have to be reviewed, no offense, I've had</p>
	  him offer before with help maintaining a freesite, and no luck there</p>
<hezekiah>	nop: I can understand that one. ;-)</p>
<hezekiah>	nop: He just asked me to forward the offer along because he</p>
	  wouldn't be here.</p>
<nop>	ok</p>
