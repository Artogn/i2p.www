15:07 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:07 < jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
15:07 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
15:07 < jrandom> 3) I2Phex mods</p>
15:07 < jrandom> 4) ???</p>
15:07 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:07  * jrandom waves</p>
15:07 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001318.html</p>
15:07 < jrandom> (i'm late, so i'll let y'all catch up on those)</p>
15:09 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on in to 1) net status</p>
15:10 < jrandom> [eom] :)</p>
15:10  * jrandom has had a good irc connection now (4+ days), so things are in pretty good shape.</p>
15:11 < jrandom> we've also got those new peer capacity graphs on stats.i2p, detailing some interesting ratios </p>
15:13 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for 1) net status?</p>
15:14 < striker> just that it looks nice.</p>
15:14 < jrandom> w00t :)</p>
15:15 < jrandom> ok, lets hop on over to 2) syndie dev status then</p>
15:15 < green> I dunno U can have 4+ days conection on IRC,, I'm disconnected somewhat every 24h even with a router not so overloaded</p>
15:15 < jrandom> green: unfortunately, its pretty arbitrary.</p>
15:16 < jrandom> (or, more precicely, the cause is dependent upon many factors without a good control over them)</p>
15:17 < green> any chance to really know why ?</p>
15:17 < green> I've plenty of tunnels even where IRC goes down</p>
15:18 < green> s/when</p>
15:18 < jrandom> yes, there's lots we can do, but i'm focusing my time on getting syndie out first</p>
15:18 < green> I know, so I've just to way more ;)</p>
15:19 < green> s/wait</p>
15:20 < green> gr f..ing keyboard</p>
15:20 < green> ok, no more on 1 let's got to 2</p>
15:20 < jrandom> w3rd</p>
15:21 < jrandom> ok, not much more to add beyond whats in the notes (well, that can reasonably be brought up)</p>
15:21 < jrandom> the webcaching discussion thread is http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1958</p>
15:22 < green> is there any plan on phpbb to syndie converter ?</p>
15:22 < jrandom> and the latest mockup image referred to is http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/mockup/forum.png</p>
15:23 < jrandom> green: hmm, i thought we discussed that in one of the meetings, but looking back at the logs, it occurred outside of a meeting</p>
15:24 < jrandom> short answer: doable, and maybe it'll get done, but its not on the immediate roadmap</p>
15:24 < jrandom> at least, not bidirectional phpbb&lt;--&gt;syndie operation</p>
15:24 < jrandom> phpbb--&gt;syndie is easy (just suck in the posts, or use server side generation)</p>
15:25 < jrandom> syndie--&gt;phpbb is easy too</p>
15:25 < jrandom> i'm not sure if the phpbb model of operation is what people will end up using syndie for though</p>
15:25 < jrandom> but we'll see</p>
15:28 < green> even just an phpbb -&gt; syndie would be enough</p>
15:30 < jrandom> cool, that'll be trivial (pulling phpbb's rendered html into a page & posting it).  a bit more complex would be pulling from phpb's database itself, though that'd give more control (but then only the phpbb admin could do it - the former method can be done by anyone)</p>
15:31 < badger> phpbb's admin is fairly flat.... not a challenge to get a hook of</p>
15:32 < badger> and there are various rss plugins available for it</p>
15:33 < jrandom> ah cool.  actually, if someone wanted to start looking into that, it'd rule - just generate an HTML page (and if you need to reference other resources, do so with the syndie URIs [syndie.i2p.net/spec.html#uri] </p>
15:34 < jrandom> (and if you need images/etc, just reference them as img src="attachment1" etc)</p>
15:34 < jrandom> (and then we can shove 'em into a syndie post with no problem)</p>
15:35 < jrandom> currently the message editor has "add text page" and "add html page" features... eventually we can toss in an "add page from the web..." that prompts you for a URL to fetch</p>
15:37 < badger> http://forum.i2p/rss_news.php</p>
15:38 < badger> translating that to syndie markup would probably be straightforward</p>
15:39 < jrandom> aye (though remember, syndie markup /is html/.  the uris are just... long and hard to read :)</p>
15:41 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev?</p>
15:42 < jrandom> if not, lets jump to 3) i2phex mods</p>
15:43 < jrandom> strike1 / Complication: wanna give us an update?</p>
15:43 < strike1> I did a quick sanity check in regards to solving the connect to self problem</p>
15:43 < strike1> http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=1965</p>
15:44 < strike1> It seems to be working okay, but is merely preventing the local dest from being added to i2phex.hosts</p>
15:44 < strike1> I am also looking into the hashing problems, and the downloading issues</p>
15:45 < jrandom> kickass!</p>
15:45 < strike1> The new mods in cvs seem to make for a slightly better i2phex so far too, I must say.</p>
15:48 < strike1> Hopefully between Complication, I, and anyone else who wants to help we can solve them all soon. :)</p>
15:49 < jrandom> wikked, thanks strike1 (& complication et al!)</p>
15:50 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for 3) i2phex mods?</p>
15:51 < jrandom> if not, lets jump to 4) ???</p>
15:51 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they'd like to bring up for the meeting?</p>
15:54 < green> any chance to have a dijjer port on I2P ?</p>
15:55 < green> wow, don't worry, just a simple question ;)</p>
15:55 < jrandom> probably not (dijjer port being a large number of public squid outproxies that cache)</p>
15:56 < jrandom> but the ability to have content hosted when you're not online will be there with syndie</p>
15:56 < jrandom> (and syndie can run over i2p)</p>
15:56 < green> sure but how syndie can handle large content ?</p>
15:57 < jrandom> technically, yes, but practically, no</p>
15:58 < green> so using cache is not a so bad idea ?</p>
15:58 < jrandom> otoh, we can have syndie distributed .torrent files for torrents that are encrypted with session keys that only those authorized on syndie know</p>
15:59 < jrandom> there's a use case for caching large files, though i'm not sure if the freenet/dijjer caching method is the best route</p>
15:59 < jrandom> (no pun intended)</p>
15:59 < green> humm .torrent files so we have to rely on a cetral server / tracker</p>
15:59 < green> s/central</p>
16:00 < jrandom> (for instance, see http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#redblue )</p>
16:01 < jrandom> green: torrents can be distributed, and you can put the same data on lots of swarms</p>
16:01 < jrandom> but functionally, we know that torrents work for transfering truckloads of data</p>
16:03 < green> There isn't so much goo tracker on I2P, so currently we rely on a central server even if it's doable to distribute torrent over a lot of tracker</p>
16:05 < jrandom> hmm, the trackers we have are good, there just isn't that much content :)</p>
16:06 < strike1> I agree though looking at postman's tracker I was impressed with what I found there as opposed to last year.</p>
16:07 < jrandom> aye, quite</p>
16:07 < strike1> Lots of nice stuff :)</p>
16:09 < jrandom> ok, anything else for the meeting?</p>
16:10 < green> (baf) :)</p>
16:10  * jrandom winds up</p>
16:10  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
