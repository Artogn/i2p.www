14:06 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:06 < jrandom> 1) Dev status</p>
14:06 < jrandom> 2) New userhosts.txt vs. hosts.txt</p>
14:06 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
14:06 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:06  * jrandom waves</p>
14:06 < jrandom> brief weekly status notes @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-September/000449.html</p>
14:06 < jrandom> (and probably brief meeting logs to be posted once this is over ;)</p>
14:07  * jrandom gives y'all a good 30s to read those notes</p>
14:07 < jrandom> anyway, moving on to 1) dev status</p>
14:07 < jrandom> basic overview of whats up is in that email</p>
14:08 < jrandom> one thing you may notice is that i won't be missing random letters in my text anymore, as my laptop has been a bitch lately</p>
14:09 < jrandom> so i'm in the process of moving entirely over to my server (w/ the laptop as backup for windows testing, etc)</p>
14:09 < jrandom> thats all i've got to say on that front</p>
14:10 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up wrt 0.4.0.1 or the dev activity?</p>
14:11 < deer> &lt;jrandom&gt; no jrandom, we're just lurking</p>
14:11 < jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) new userhosts.txt vs. hosts.txt</p>
14:11 < protok0l> yey!</p>
14:11 < jrandom> minor new feature so people can modify their local naming while still pulling down hosts.txt</p>
14:12 < protok0l> which file has priority if they conflict? user i would assume</p>
14:13 < jrandom> it'll be rolled out in the next release, so basically just put your local changes in userhosts.txt as hosts.txt will be overridden</p>
14:13 < jrandom> userhosts.txt has first preference</p>
14:15 < jrandom> ok, thats all i've got for 2, so moving on quickly to our last point- 3) ???</p>
14:15 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to discuss?</p>
14:16 < deer> &lt;Pseudonym&gt; timetable for 0.4.1?</p>
14:17 < jrandom> should be out this week, but maybe not until the weekend.</p>
14:17 < deer> &lt;Pseudonym&gt; cool</p>
14:17 < jrandom> i finally gave up the battle with my laptop after the spacebar died</p>
14:17 < jrandom> (codingWithoutSpaces==lame;)</p>
14:18 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything they want to bring up?  i think we're going for a record meeting time here</p>
14:18 < jrandom> (not that thats a problem)</p>
14:19 < jrandom> ok, if not</p>
14:19  * jrandom winds up</p>
14:19  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
