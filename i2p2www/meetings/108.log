14:06 < jrandom> 3) ???
14:06 < jrandom> 0) hi
14:06  * jrandom waves
14:06 < jrandom> brief weekly status notes @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-September/000449.html
14:06 < jrandom> (and probably brief meeting logs to be posted once this is over ;)
14:07  * jrandom gives y'all a good 30s to read those notes
14:07 < jrandom> anyway, moving on to 1) dev status
14:07 < jrandom> basic overview of whats up is in that email
14:08 < jrandom> one thing you may notice is that i won't be missing random letters in my text anymore, as my laptop has been a bitch lately
14:09 < jrandom> so i'm in the process of moving entirely over to my server (w/ the laptop as backup for windows testing, etc)
14:09 < jrandom> thats all i've got to say on that front
14:10 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up wrt 0.4.0.1 or the dev activity?
14:11 < deer> <jrandom> no jrandom, we're just lurking
14:11 < jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) new userhosts.txt vs. hosts.txt
14:11 < protok0l> yey!
14:11 < jrandom> minor new feature so people can modify their local naming while still pulling down hosts.txt
14:12 < protok0l> which file has priority if they conflict? user i would assume
14:13 < jrandom> it'll be rolled out in the next release, so basically just put your local changes in userhosts.txt as hosts.txt will be overridden
14:13 < jrandom> userhosts.txt has first preference
14:15 < jrandom> ok, thats all i've got for 2, so moving on quickly to our last point- 3) ???
14:15 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to discuss?
14:16 < deer> <Pseudonym> timetable for 0.4.1?
14:17 < jrandom> should be out this week, but maybe not until the weekend.
14:17 < deer> <Pseudonym> cool
14:17 < jrandom> i finally gave up the battle with my laptop after the spacebar died
14:17 < jrandom> (codingWithoutSpaces==lame;)
14:18 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything they want to bring up?  i think we're going for a record meeting time here
14:18 < jrandom> (not that thats a problem)
14:19 < jrandom> ok, if not
14:19  * jrandom winds up
14:19  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
