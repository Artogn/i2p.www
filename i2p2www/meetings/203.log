<div class="irclog">
16:05 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
16:05 < jrandom> 1) Net status and 0.6.1.28</p>
16:05 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
16:05 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
16:05 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
16:05  * jrandom waves</p>
16:05 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-March/001341.html</p>
16:05  * jrandom only recently posted that, so i'll give y'all a minute to read that exiting note ;)</p>
16:08 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on into 1) net status and 0.6.1.28</p>
16:09 < jrandom> things are looking pretty good so far with about half of the net upgraded</p>
16:09 < jrandom> an interesting data point is that the net has grown a bit too, added perhaps another 40-50 active ntcp connections to my router and i see around 700 known router idents</p>
16:10 < jrandom> we'll see how that progresses over the next week or so though</p>
16:11 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything to bring up re: net status or 0.6.1.28?</p>
16:13 < jrandom> ok, if not, lets swing on over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
16:13 < jrandom> lots going on in that front, as mentioned in the notes</p>
16:13 < Amiga4000> hi</p>
16:13 < jrandom> heya Amiga4000 </p>
16:13 < Amiga4000> which point now?</p>
16:13 < jrandom> we just hopped over to 2, but if you have something to bring up for 1, hit me ;?</p>
16:14 < Amiga4000> yeah, posted in syndie right now, I assume my pool isn't working as aspected</p>
16:14 < jrandom> pool?</p>
16:14 < Amiga4000> 2 pout tunnels 2 hops, one 70sec and 1300kb, one 250sec and 1000 kb</p>
16:15 < Amiga4000> ( I refer to the msg in zzz forum on syndie about I2Psnark and pooling inside router)</p>
16:15 < jrandom> i assume those times are expiration times, right, and data is total transferred so far</p>
16:15 < Amiga4000> damned, right</p>
16:15 < jrandom> ok, i replied to that post in syndie - what you see is good</p>
16:15 < Amiga4000> *fine*</p>
16:16 < Amiga4000> sry, wqas to fast in read and not understanding</p>
16:16 < jrandom> if all tunnels expired at the same time, there'd be a rush and a good chance of total failures</p>
16:16 < Amiga4000> correct, any chance to see the lifteime of a tunnel?</p>
16:16 < jrandom> 1300KB and 1000KB is pretty good balancing too</p>
16:16 < jrandom> lifetime is always 10 minutes</p>
16:17 < Amiga4000> ok, I track some more data :_)</p>
16:18 < jrandom> w3wt, thanks for asking about it though, its a good question</p>
16:18 < Amiga4000> ok, and net status: 0.1.28 is fine, although upload of i2psnakr data is slow</p>
16:19 < jrandom> hmm, you were describing 10-15KBps though, right?</p>
16:19 < Amiga4000> right, it was 30-40 before the last 2 or 3 changes by zzz</p>
16:20 < jrandom> hmm, lets see how it progresses as the new-release churn reduces</p>
16:20 < Amiga4000> yes, lets wait 1-2 weeks more :-)</p>
16:20 < jrandom> though in my view, 10-15KBps is good enough</p>
16:21 < Amiga4000> :-)</p>
16:21 < jrandom> (i was actually using the 10-20 range as my target for reasonable usage, rather than 1-5KBps)</p>
16:21 < jrandom> of course, more is better, but a solid 10-15 is great news</p>
16:21 < Amiga4000> I just know it has done the 2-4x of that</p>
16:21 < _bob> Hmm, i2p is using 120% CPU. ;)</p>
16:22 < Amiga4000> and I still can grab data from "internet" via the outproxy&lt; in 20-40 kb rate</p>
16:22 < jadeSerpent> _bob: hope your heatsink/fan is working</p>
16:22 < jrandom> you're referring to kilobytes per second, right Amiga4000?</p>
16:22 < Amiga4000> right</p>
16:23 < jrandom> cool</p>
16:23 < Amiga4000> and even syndie.i2p is in the 40 range</p>
16:23 < jrandom> bob: or you've got a dual or quad proc pc ;)</p>
16:24 < _bob> Didn't know top reported values over 100%.</p>
16:24 < jrandom> i2p is just magic</p>
16:24 < jadeSerpent> i guess it's over the top</p>
16:25 < _bob> Wish I did. Can only route around 150KB/s in each direction as it is now.</p>
16:25  * jadeSerpent dodges rotten fruit</p>
16:27 < jadeSerpent> i have a core 2 duo and i sometimes see various processes using &gt;100%</p>
16:29 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for 1? </p>
16:30 < jrandom> if not, really moving on to 2 ;)</p>
16:30 < jrandom> not much more to add to that here beyond whats in the mail and the forum</p>
16:30 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up re: 2) syndie dev status?</p>
16:30 < jadeSerpent> i can't wait to try the new editor widget</p>
16:30 < jadeSerpent> the current one is driving me nuts</p>
16:30 < jrandom> heh</p>
16:31 < jadeSerpent> how were you able to pull in native editors on the various platforms?</p>
16:31 < Eric> Just a quick question...why does Susimail take so long to check mail or load? Other .i2p pages load quickly.</p>
16:32 < jadeSerpent> Eric: pop3 is a very verbose protocol, moreseo than http (more packets exchanged per operation)</p>
16:32 < Eric> Ah, alright.</p>
16:33 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: import org.eclipse.swt.widget.Text instead of ...swt.custom.StyledText ;)</p>
16:33 < _bob> Eric = Protocol?</p>
16:33 < jrandom> Eric: aye, the app runs locally but talks a full pop3 subset to the pop3 server</p>
16:34 < jadeSerpent> jrandom: ah so swt does interface to com frameworks</p>
16:34 < Eric> Why not use webmail over HTTP as opposed to a local client fetching and sending via POP/SMTP?</p>
16:34 < jadeSerpent> nm i'll just read the code</p>
16:35 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: well, its a native /text/ widget, not the com html editor widget</p>
16:35 < jadeSerpent> Eric: ask postman that question, and preferably in #i2p-chat ;)</p>
16:35 < Eric> Okay.</p>
16:35 < jadeSerpent> jrandom: oh</p>
16:35  * jadeSerpent was thinking gedit/console/riched32</p>
16:36 < jadeSerpent> s/console/kate/</p>
16:36 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: the com html editor widget is easy enough to integrate too, but itd require a lot of issues</p>
16:36 < jadeSerpent> yeah best do your own parsing for security</p>
16:36 < jrandom> (eg auditing it for security, especially when quoting content)</p>
16:39 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 2), lets jump to 3) ???</p>
16:39 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up for the meeting?</p>
16:40 < jadeSerpent> how's the situation with registerfly</p>
16:40 < jadeSerpent> is i2p.net saved? ;)</p>
16:41 < jrandom> eh not yet sorted, hope to get it dealt with soon</p>
16:41 < jrandom> but y'all have 66.111.51.110 memorized anyway, right?  ;)</p>
16:41 < _bob> i2p.net will soon serve you ads and ads. ;)</p>
16:42 < jadeSerpent> yes, it's the same number i use for the combination on my briefcase</p>
16:42 < jadeSerpent> _bob: that's one of my fears :(</p>
16:43 < jadeSerpent> or redirect to SiteFinder</p>
16:43 < jadeSerpent> what a mess registerfly created heh</p>
16:43 < jrandom> it'll get sorted in the next day or two</p>
16:44 < Eric> Heh, now I remember where I've seen that IP. It's the outproxy IP address.</p>
16:44 < snoopy> jr: check this page, re i2p.net: http://www.dyndns.com/news/releases/registerfly_safe_harbor.html</p>
16:44 < jrandom> aye eric :)</p>
16:46 < jrandom> snoopy: most of the registrars out there are offering discounts to scoop up ex-registerfly users (though luckily we're technically an enom registrant)</p>
16:46  * jrandom just needs to get onto a secure term (tried to earlier today, but the place was closed)</p>
16:47 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?</p>
16:49 < jrandom> if not...</p>
16:49  * jrandom winds up</p>
16:50  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
