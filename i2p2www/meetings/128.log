13:05 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
13:05 < jrandom> 1) 0.4.2.6-*</p>
13:05 < jrandom> 2) 0.5</p>
13:05 < jrandom> 3) i2p-bt 0.1.6</p>
13:05 < jrandom> 4) fortuna</p>
13:05 < jrandom> 5) ???</p>
13:06 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
13:06  * jrandom waves</p>
13:06 <@duck> y0</p>
13:06 < smeghead> hi</p>
13:06 < jrandom> weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-February/000564.html</p>
13:07 < cervantes> sorry I'm late...I was busy reading the status notes that were posted at the last minute...</p>
13:07 < jrandom> hey, this week they were /before/ the meeting at least (by 30s or so ;)</p>
13:08 < jrandom> anyway, while you dig through that oh so exciting email, lets jump on into 1) 0.4.2.6-*</p>
13:09 < jrandom> with the latest patches from anon et al, i'm torn between pushing out a new 0.4.2.7 so close to the 0.5 rev.  </p>
13:10 < jrandom> for the moment though, if you're feeling brave, feel free to give cvs a whirl - its stable (i'm breaking things off on another branch), and has some good stuff</p>
13:11 < jrandom> the deciding factor for not pushing a rev out was when i did a checklist for 0.5 and found that the only things left were really web interface updates</p>
13:11 <+Ragnarok> about the patches from sugadude, they do represent a policy change, as we discussed filtering out non .i2p addresses before, and you decided against it</p>
13:11 < jrandom> oh, hrm?  i disagree with my old self then - eepproxy doesn't accept non-.i2p address in any case, even if they were in hosts.txt</p>
13:12 < jrandom> did i have a convincing argument before?</p>
13:13 <+Ragnarok> ok, then can we revert the patch, and I can implement it the way it originally worked, which is a 0 line change?</p>
13:13 <+Ragnarok> not really, I just didn't care either way :)</p>
13:13 < jrandom> oh, cool you're the boss</p>
13:13 < cervantes> well you convinced me to drop all my work on a multi-tld management system and fire all my employees</p>
13:13 <+Ragnarok> filtering is already happening, so it's just adding a condition to an if statement</p>
13:14 < jrandom> cervantes: there's also this beautiful bridge i've got for sale...</p>
13:14 < cervantes> :)</p>
13:14 < jrandom> ok word Ragnarok, if you want to send me a .java/.tar/.diff/.whatever, that'd be great</p>
13:15 <+Ragnarok> I can do cvs now :)</p>
13:15 < jrandom> :) even better</p>
13:15  * cervantes backs up cvs head</p>
13:15 < jrandom> heh</p>
13:16 <+Ragnarok> *BOOM*</p>
13:16 <+Ragnarok> ... just kidding :)</p>
13:17 < jrandom> ok, other than that, anyone have anything else to bring up wrt 0.4.*?</p>
13:17 < ant> &lt;dm>gt; 0.4.* sucks, give us 0.5</p>
13:17 < ant> &lt;dm>gt; It's like a gazillion years old!!</p>
13:18 < ant> &lt;fvw>gt; 0.4.* doesn't suck, give us 0.5 anyway.</p>
13:18 < jrandom> 2) 0.5 it is then :)</p>
13:19 < ant> &lt;dm>gt; you guys owe me big time, I brought 0.5</p>
13:19 < jrandom> we couldn't'a done it without ya dm </p>
13:19 < ant> &lt;dm>gt; amen</p>
13:20 < jrandom> as mentioned in the notes, pretty much all the heavy lifting for 0.5 is done and tested, but there are still the odds and ends left to fix up</p>
13:21 < jrandom> (e.g. the next task on my list is a tunnel config page to manage the pools and settings)</p>
13:22 <@duck> I hope we will have a test-0.5 network before releasing?</p>
13:22 < jrandom> there have been updates to lots of different components though, so 0.5 might be a bit bumpy</p>
13:22 < ant> &lt;dm>gt; jrandom HAS a test network already.. duh</p>
13:23 < jrandom> aye, i've been doing one locally here with a dozen routers, but in the next day or two i'll try to snag some people to help with some wide area tests</p>
13:24  * postman can offer a dedicated machine</p>
13:24 < jrandom> wikked.  perhaps we can try something out tomorrow, try to break some things.  </p>
13:26 < cervantes> as can I</p>
13:27 < jrandom> word</p>
13:27 < jrandom> thats about all i have to say about the upcoming 0.5 at the moment - the cvs commit logs have been pretty verbose, so if you want the nitty gritty, hit 'em up</p>
13:28 < jrandom> anyone else have any comments/questions/concerns/frisbees wrt 0.5?</p>
13:29 <+postman> no</p>
13:29  * postman is looking forward to get the new V8 running :)</p>
13:30 < jrandom2p> well, 0.5 is more of a new tank - designed to improve security and anonymity, not as a performance tweak ;)</p>
13:30 < jrandom2p> but i agree, its been too long</p>
13:30 <@duck> dont forget to add a 0.5 target to bugzilla</p>
13:30 <@duck> in case there are bugs</p>
13:30 < jrandom2p> (heh, did i even add a 0.4?)</p>
13:31 < jrandom2p> but good call</p>
13:31 <@duck> or would you like bugs elsewhere</p>
13:31 <@duck> err bugreports :)</p>
13:31 <@duck> I know that I have been lazy and abuse irc messages for them</p>
13:31 < jrandom2p> no, bugzilla is great, much better than my notebook</p>
13:32 < jrandom2p> i don't blame you, as bugzilla is a bit of a pain</p>
13:32 < jrandom2p> but as bugs pile up, its for the best</p>
13:32 <@duck> nah</p>
13:33  * jrandom just noticed i'm switching schitzophrenically between screens</p>
13:34 < jrandom> ok, anyway, moving on to 3) i2p-bt 0.1.6</p>
13:34 < jrandom> duck: you've got the mic </p>
13:34 <@duck> ok</p>
13:34 <@duck> i2p-bt 0.1.5 had some issues, the two biggest ones:</p>
13:35 <@duck> - resource temporarily unavailable</p>
13:35 <@duck> - invalid argument error on windows</p>
13:35 <@duck> both have been fixed</p>
13:35 < jrandom> (yay!)</p>
13:35 <@duck> while I tried to blame the sam protocol, the sam bridge and winsock</p>
13:35 <@duck> the problem turned out to be related to non-blocking socket code</p>
13:36 <@duck> I yet have to see 0.1.6 crash</p>
13:36 <@duck> some other issues are not addressed:</p>
13:36 <@duck> the GUI users have been complaining about the popups</p>
13:36 <@duck> you can comment them out, but I didnt like that</p>
13:37 <@duck> still waiting for someone to implement a better solution</p>
13:37 <@duck> like showing a status line on the transfer window itself</p>
13:37  * smeghead hides</p>
13:37 < smeghead> i looked at that last night actually</p>
13:37 < smeghead> but it's not at the top of my priority list</p>
13:37 <@duck> or maybe one day I will look into how wxPython works and do it myself</p>
13:37 <@duck> but it's not at the top of my priority list</p>
13:38 <@duck> and I dont use the GUI, so I dont really care :P</p>
13:38 <+Ragnarok> there's always the new gui from 3.9 :)</p>
13:38 <@duck> is it any better?</p>
13:38 < smeghead> yes why did you base i2p bt on such a crusty version in the first place? :)</p>
13:38 <@duck> because it was the stable release at that moment</p>
13:39 <@duck> and not as mutilated as clients like bittornado</p>
13:40 <@duck> Ragnarok: ignoring licensing issues, I think that porting our i2p things to 3.9 might be good</p>
13:40 <+Ragnarok> the new gui is pretty awsome, imho, and it's written using pygtk, so I can actually hack on it</p>
13:40 < jrandom> what's 3.9's license?  i thought it was mit-esque?</p>
13:40 <+protokol> i would love a more recent jetty version</p>
13:40 < smeghead> protokol: that's coming sooner than you think</p>
13:41 <@duck> "BitTorrent Open Source License"</p>
13:41 < smeghead> flavor of the month license</p>
13:41 <+Ragnarok> I haven't read all of it.. it seems odd</p>
13:41 <+protokol> licencing does not exist on i2p</p>
13:41 <@duck> derived from the Jabber Open Source License 1.0</p>
13:41 <+protokol> if there is source, its PD</p>
13:41 <@duck> protokol: that is why I said 'ignoring'</p>
13:42 < smeghead> and the jabber license is based on?</p>
13:42 < jrandom> (out of date copyright laws?)</p>
13:42 < smeghead> besides that :)</p>
13:43 < modulus> Sun's wish to fuck about.</p>
13:43 <@duck> http://www.opensource.org/licenses/jabberpl.php</p>
13:43 < smeghead> i move we schedule the licensing issue for the next meeting of the I2P Public Domain Security Council</p>
13:43 < modulus> ah, that one</p>
13:43 < modulus> misheard.</p>
13:45 <@duck> 3.9.0 looks hot</p>
13:45 <@duck> it is still beta though</p>
13:47 <@duck> ok, those willing to help, please let me know</p>
13:47 <@duck> so we can look into using 3.9.x</p>
13:47 <@duck> .</p>
13:47 < jrandom> w3rd</p>
13:47 < smeghead> i'm willing to help out</p>
13:47 < jrandom> i'm willing to help test</p>
13:48 <+Ragnarok> I'm willing, but there are likely to be time constraints, as I am currently having the semester from hell.</p>
13:48 < jrandom> d'oh</p>
13:48 <@duck> drop out</p>
13:48 < jrandom> damn, duck beat me</p>
13:48 < smeghead> yes, everyone does it</p>
13:49 <+Ragnarok> boo</p>
13:49 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; just join the military ;)</p>
13:50 < jrandom> yeah, as that'll give you lots of time to code, 'eh?  ;)</p>
13:50 <+Ragnarok> I've already given up on being a math major, that's as much as you're getting from me :)</p>
13:50 < jrandom> heh</p>
13:50 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything on 3) i2p-bt?  </p>
13:51 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; just don't sign up for six years</p>
13:51 <@duck> quite a bit of forum posts on it</p>
13:51 <@duck> thanks to those who aid the newbies</p>
13:51 <@duck> s/thanks/my thanks/</p>
13:51 <@duck> if you have stuff for a FAQ, lemme kno</p>
13:52 < jrandom> (if we still had drupal, we could just add a new node...)</p>
13:53 < jrandom> ok, anyway, moving on to 4) fortuna</p>
13:54 < jrandom> smeghead: wanna give us an update on things?</p>
13:54 < smeghead> yes, i'm working on pants and fortuna in tandem</p>
13:55 < smeghead> since i needed to modify fortuna's build to turn it into a pbuild</p>
13:55 < smeghead> eta on a patch that will let you test fortuna is a day or two, maybe tonight depending on what drugs are involved</p>
13:56 < jrandom> heh</p>
13:56 <@duck> so you'll get your pants down?</p>
13:56 < jrandom> ok, cool, whenever is fine - if we get it in for 0.5 in the next week or so, thats great, if not, thats great too</p>
13:56 < smeghead> well even if i finish it tonight, i would take a conservative stance on deployment</p>
13:57 < jrandom> reasonable enough</p>
13:57 < smeghead> until we get some decent testing in</p>
13:57 < smeghead> since this will be at the heart of most of i2p's crypto</p>
13:57 < jrandom> aye</p>
13:57 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; will jbigi stay?</p>
13:57 < smeghead> your new entropy class is cool</p>
13:58 < jrandom> yeah jnymo, this is just a random # generator</p>
13:58 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; ah</p>
13:59 < jrandom> we'll still need to do some research into the quality of various entropy sources in the router, but I think we'll be able to feed it some data.</p>
14:00 < smeghead> btw if anyone wants to read what this pants thing is about: http://smeghead.i2p/README_pants</p>
14:00 < jrandom> oh wikked</p>
14:01 < smeghead> pants is almost done too</p>
14:01 < brachtus> i know jbigi is kinda hard to get working with OS X/Darwin... will this have the same build problems?</p>
14:01 < smeghead> what is the issue on osx?</p>
14:01 < modulus> it's just you have to build the lib</p>
14:02 < modulus> not a big deal imo, but somewhat troublesome.</p>
14:02 < jrandom> brachtus: fortuna is in pure java, doesnt use anything native</p>
14:02 < smeghead> i can put jbigi into pants and that should make building a cinch if we ship pants with i2p</p>
14:02 < brachtus> nothign terribly difficult, it's like building a shared lib on linux, but harder than just double-click-install</p>
14:02 < smeghead> you'd need ant of course</p>
14:02 < brachtus> ok jrandom, that's great :)</p>
14:03 < jrandom> smeghead: thats actually a good point - jbigi has a pants dependency upon GMP</p>
14:03 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; what is pants?</p>
14:03 < smeghead> no manual mucking would be necessary</p>
14:03 < ant> * jnymo doesn't have a router up</p>
14:03 < smeghead> jnymo: read that link i just posted</p>
14:04 < jrandom> http://bolas.mine.nu:8080/cgi-bin/nph-proxy/000000A/http/smeghead.i2p/README_pants</p>
14:04 < smeghead> pants can build gmp too</p>
14:04 < jrandom> (public inproxy)</p>
14:04 < smeghead> ah nice</p>
14:04 < jrandom> yuck, that totally b0rked the text</p>
14:04 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; thanks jr</p>
14:04 < ant> &lt;fvw>gt; aren't you afraid of legal trouble?</p>
14:04 < smeghead> jrandom doesn't run the inproxy</p>
14:04 < jrandom> oh, the inproy is run by someone else, its been posted to the forum</p>
14:05 < jrandom> (see http://bolas.mine.nu:8080/)</p>
14:05 < cervantes> jrandom: it shouldn't be viewed as an html file...check the source</p>
14:05 < ant> &lt;fvw>gt; still, I'm amazed anyone would. But as long as it's being run by someone not vital to the project, fine :)</p>
14:05 < jrandom> hehe</p>
14:05 < jrandom> we're /all/ vital to the project :)</p>
14:06 < smeghead> fvw: i don't see inproxies as legally precarious as outrpoxies</p>
14:06 < smeghead> outproxies even</p>
14:06 < ant> &lt;fvw>gt; Perhaps not, but they can still serve up child porn and such</p>
14:06 < jrandom> only if there were such things on i2p, which, to my knowledge, there isnt </p>
14:06 < legion> outproxies could route through tor, just to be a little safer, since they would just be used for webrowsing I don't see it as a problem.</p>
14:07 < jrandom> (but yeah)</p>
14:07 < modulus> yet</p>
14:07 < ant> &lt;fvw>gt; yeah, but anyone can put it on at any point.</p>
14:07 < ant> &lt;fvw>gt; yeah, I wouldn't run a tor outproxy either. Anyway, sorry for drifting offtopic like that</p>
14:07 < jrandom> legion: yeah, though i tossed up squid.i2p before tor was out</p>
14:07 < ant> &lt;duck_>gt; to get back on topic; looking forward to pants</p>
14:08 < jrandom> aye, pants++</p>
14:08 < smeghead> i'll let you know before i drop pants on CVS</p>
14:08 < smeghead> it's kinda big</p>
14:08 < ant> &lt;duck_>gt; folks outside of i2p might be interested in it too</p>
14:09 < cervantes> yes let us all know before you drop your pants</p>
14:09 < smeghead> yes, i intend to publicise it outside of i2p also</p>
14:09 < jrandom> agreed, perhaps we should put it in another module (or on the new fast/large server)?</p>
14:09 <+Ragnarok> especially if you're a big pants kind of guy</p>
14:10 < smeghead> yes the pants module really should be kept separate from the pants repo in the source tree, currently i have them located in the same apps/pants root</p>
14:10 < smeghead> :/</p>
14:10 < smeghead> which i don't have to tell you is total pants</p>
14:11 < smeghead> so what were we talking about originally?</p>
14:11 < jrandom> hmm, we can discuss deployment options offline</p>
14:11 < jrandom> fortuna ;)</p>
14:11 < smeghead> right</p>
14:12 < jrandom> smeghead: have you looked at the AES/SHA256 needs of the impl?</p>
14:12 < jrandom> (as i2p's SHA256 doesn't do partial digests)</p>
14:13 < smeghead> hm</p>
14:13 < jrandom> AES we've got perfectly suitable block impl though</p>
14:13 < smeghead> i guess i'll find out when it blows up</p>
14:13 < jrandom> anyway, we can work those through too</p>
14:13 < jrandom> heh</p>
14:15 < jrandom> ok, anyone have any questions/thoughts/concerns on fortuna?</p>
14:15 < jrandom> if not, hopping on over to 5) ???</p>
14:15 < jrandom> cervantes: p1ng</p>
14:16 < cervantes> http://forum.i2p/viewtopic.php?t=305</p>
14:16 < cervantes> we have a new forum member of the week</p>
14:16 < cervantes> I present [drumroll] Sugadude!</p>
14:16  * brachtus applauds Sugadude</p>
14:17 < jrandom> yay</p>
14:17 < cervantes> for generally being a helpful sod to all those i2p n00bs</p>
14:17 <@duck> nice avatar too</p>
14:17 < cervantes> avatar(s)</p>
14:18 < legion> avatars? didn't know that we could have avatars on the i2p forums?</p>
14:18 < smeghead> only users who are really really bad get them</p>
14:18 < cervantes> you can't...unless you're a forum person of the week ;-)</p>
14:18 <@duck> only for the elite</p>
14:18 < legion> oh, i see...</p>
14:19 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; i know someone was interested in secure financial systems over i2p</p>
14:19 < legion> makes sense :)</p>
14:19 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; don't know if they're here, but...</p>
14:19 <@duck> I am a smelly anarcho capitalist</p>
14:19 <@duck> so try me</p>
14:20 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; i was reading more on threashold cryptography and theres talk about using it for that</p>
14:20 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; as well as securing other functions</p>
14:21 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; everyone familiar with threshold cryptography?</p>
14:21 < legion> IMO that cryptography and network security should be variable, how much should depend on the feature/task.</p>
14:21 < ant> &lt;duck_>gt; jnymo: a bit</p>
14:22 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; well, for trustable financial transactions in i2p, we want strong decentralized trust</p>
14:22 < modulus> is that about the shared keys and shit like that?</p>
14:23 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; yea, keys are shared in pieces</p>
14:23 < ant> &lt;duck_>gt; but in an anonymous environment, how do you know that the entities doing the sharing arent controlled by the same one?</p>
14:23 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; and you need to circumvent more than half of all the servers in the system to obtain the priv key</p>
14:24 < modulus> afaik it's kind of complicated the issue of distributed key generations though.</p>
14:24 < legion> yeah but in a system of millions that would be hard (yeah i2p is small at the moment, but hopefully it will grow much larger soon).</p>
14:25 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; atomic communications, or something.. but yea, theres issues with taking on new nodes on the system, which i thing are being worked out</p>
14:25 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; think</p>
14:25 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; so maybe its not developed enough, but i'd bet some usage of threshold crypto will end up over i2p at some point</p>
14:26 < jrandom> neat</p>
14:26 < legion> dunno, maybe</p>
14:26 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; someone has already built a DNSSEC addon with threshold crypto</p>
14:27 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; and a wrapper around bind</p>
14:27 < jrandom> thresholds work fine when identity is scarce</p>
14:27 < jrandom> in anonymous networks, however, identity is free</p>
14:27 < legion> I'd figure at the moment the highest priority is to get it more user friendly and debugged.</p>
14:27 < jrandom> (want a new destination?  want 100,000?)</p>
14:28 < legion> granted it's cool whenever a new service/feature is developed.</p>
14:28 < jrandom> aye, commerce and finance on top of i2p will be nice</p>
14:28 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; yea, and i wouldn't know if atomic commo would work over a 10000 node threshold crypto sys</p>
14:29 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; well, that's all i had to say :)</p>
14:30 < jrandom> heh cool, definitely feel free to post up neat stuff to the forum or whatnot whenever</p>
14:30 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything for the meeting?</p>
14:32 <+ugha2p> I suck.</p>
14:33 < jrandom> whats up ugha2p?</p>
14:33 < ant> &lt;jnymo>gt; glad you got that off your' chest, ugha ;)</p>
14:33 <+ugha2p> I never remember the meetings. :)</p>
14:33 < jrandom> heh</p>
14:33 < jrandom> well, the logs will be posted soon, 90 minutes of action packed fun</p>
14:34 < jrandom> well, on that note</p>
14:34  * jrandom winds up</p>
14:34  * Curiosity waves to jrandom and stays thank-you! :D</p>
14:34 < ant> * jnymo pitches the meeting ball</p>
14:34  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
