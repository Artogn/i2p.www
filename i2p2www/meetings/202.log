16:02 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
16:02  * jrandom waves</p>
16:02 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-March/001338.html</p>
16:02 < jrandom> y'all've had a few hours to read those (and of course to read the related syndie posts ;) so lets just jump in to 1) net status and 0.6.1.28</p>
16:04 < jrandom> there's been a bunch going on in this front lately - zzz wanna gives us a rundown of whats coming in 0.6.1.28?</p>
16:05 <+zzz> ok</p>
16:06 <+zzz> lots of improvements in tunnel building and upstream performance, mainly benefitting those who have a lot of outbound traffic or are upstream-bandwidth-constrained...</p>
16:06 <+zzz> like i2psnark users...</p>
16:06 <+zzz> I'm getting good results in testing so looking forward to getting it out there to all...</p>
16:07 < jrandom> [w3wt]</p>
16:07 <+zzz> I have one tweak to make a parameter configurable, as requested by Amiga4000, should get that in soon.</p>
16:08 <+zzz> And thx for the $$ offer, however please keep it in the bank.</p>
16:08 <+zzz> EOT :)</p>
16:08 < jrandom> r0x0r - added to halloffame.html :)</p>
16:09 <+zzz> haha I'm famous now</p>
16:10 < jrandom> the changes look pretty promising, and they do seem that they'll have their largest impact once its widely deployed</p>
16:11 < jrandom> just bounce me a msg when you want me to pull the trigger and i'll get it packaged and pushed w/in a day or so</p>
16:11 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything they'd like to bring up re: net status?</p>
16:13 < jrandom> if not, lets hop on over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
16:14 < jrandom> lots going on here (as you can see if you're using syndie or following https://trac.i2p.net/timeline )</p>
16:14 < jrandom> i expect we'll have a new 1.005a release in the next day or two (obviously not including the things we're discussing in (3) below)</p>
16:15 < TrevorReznik> jrandom: do you have time for a short query?</p>
16:17 < jrandom> if its for the meeting, certainly (if its on 2), now is good, if it doesnt fit the agenda, we've got 5) ??? for everything else :)</p>
16:17 < jrandom> (if its not something for the meeting, hit me as a priv msg)</p>
16:17 < TrevorReznik> ok ;) ill wait</p>
16:18 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything for 2) syndie dev status?</p>
16:20 < jrandom> if not, lets switch to 3) Syndie GUI directions</p>
16:20 < jrandom> as mentioned in the mail, lots going on in this direction - mk has put together some really interesting ideas and we'll likely see it in syndie sooner rather than later</p>
16:20 <+zzz> call me a traditionalist, but I think the current multipane thunderbird-like i/f is pretty good</p>
16:24 < jrandom> hmm, with the multipane view, would that fit more with mk's mods than our current multitab interface though?</p>
16:24 < jrandom> do you use the preview tab on the thread view now, for instance?</p>
16:26 <+zzz> right now there's no choice but to go to the preview tab to see attachments, which I don't like - would rather just see the whole thing in the lower pane</p>
16:26 <+zzz> sorry not conversant in the details of mk's mods so can't answer your other question</p>
16:27 < jrandom> ah, so it would work better w/ mk's view (once we get it using the MessageView instead of MessagePreview down there)</p>
16:27 < jrandom> oh, there's a screencap of mk's proposal up at http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/mk_max.png</p>
16:27 < jrandom> mk: perhaps we could find a way to make the tree above vs. left configurable?</p>
16:29 <+zzz> thunderbird used to give you a choice of 2 or 3 layouts for the 3 panes, but can't find it in the options atm</p>
16:30 < jrandom> i remember reviewing their diagram for that, yeah</p>
16:31 < jrandom> perhaps if we can find a way to get mk's "explorer" parentable cleanly in an arbitrary SWT Composite we could use it both via the current tabbed GUI as a tab and in the fullscreen mode as a screen</p>
16:33 <+zzz> I like the tabs for the less-common stuff like options, syndication configuration, etc; I think that tabs combined with the multipane for the common stuff is good. imho anyway.</p>
16:34 < jrandom> do you run syndie fullscreen or only in part of the screen</p>
16:35 <+zzz> usually full</p>
16:35 < jrandom> hmm cool</p>
16:36 <+zzz> but because I'm using a 1024x768 laptop these days... on my 1600x1200 desktop I wouldn't take up the whole screen</p>
16:37 < jrandom> ok, for all y-all watching in the background, please post up your thoughts and ideas whenever its convient for you</p>
16:37 < jrandom> heh aye, makes sense</p>
16:38  * jrandom is on an 800x600 net cafe box atm</p>
16:38 <@detonate> hmm, i'm having trouble getting i2p working again</p>
16:39 <@detonate> it's doing something, using lots of cpu, but the web console doesn't seem to ever start</p>
16:39 <@detonate> i guess i could try running it in windows</p>
16:39 < jrandom> anything in the logs?</p>
16:39 <@detonate> not really, it just says that i need to reseed</p>
16:39 <@detonate> are the logs quieter than before?</p>
16:39 <+zzz> wrapper.log NPE's?</p>
16:41 < jrandom> ok, if there isn't anything else for 3, lets jump on to 4) Feb bug harvesting contest results</p>
16:42 < jrandom> congrats & thanks to void, Darn, and Anonymous!  </p>
16:42 < jrandom> (and to everyone else who has helped out, of course)</p>
16:42 < jrandom> bug reports help us track down these issues and make sure they get taken care of, so please keep 'em coming</p>
16:43 < jrandom> ok, if there isn't anything on 4), lets jump to 5) ???</p>
16:43 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up for the meeting?</p>
16:45 < bar> there was someone asking in the forums why the graphs displaying bw seem a bit off</p>
16:45 < bar> thought you might have an idea or two</p>
16:46 < bar> (basically, they peak at 1.5 x max bw setting)</p>
16:47 < jrandom> aye, wasn't sure *which* bw graphs they were referring to (each of the graphs accurrately render the stat which they represent, from what i've seen)</p>
16:47 <@detonate> nm, it's working again :)</p>
16:48 <+zzz> it's the first 3 graphs on graphs.jsp, which seem much higher than the bw displayed on the left side of the router console, and for me are much higher than my configured upstream limit</p>
16:49  * jrandom loads</p>
16:51 < jrandom> hmm, and that includes the upstream avg w/ burst in mind?</p>
16:52 <+zzz> yes</p>
16:52 < jrandom> hmm, ill look into it</p>
16:53 <+zzz> I'll investigate further, guess it doesn't ring a bell for you</p>
16:53 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
16:57 < jrandom> if not...</p>
16:57  * jrandom winds up</p>
16:58  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
