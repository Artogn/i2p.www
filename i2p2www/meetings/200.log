15:04 < jrandom> 4) ???
15:04 < jrandom> 0) hi
15:04  * jrandom waves
15:04 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-February/001334.html 
15:05 < jrandom> lets jump on in to 1) Net status and 0.6.1.27
15:06 < jrandom> zzz: wanna give us the rundown of the main bugfixes/improvements we'll find in i2psnark?
15:07 <+zzz> um, it's all over the map, see history.txt :)
15:07 < green> We can't say anything about that since you don't have work on it for a long time, humm !
15:08 < green> So there isn't new to discuss
15:08 < jrandom> heh ok zzz, fair 'nuff :)
15:08 <+zzz> should be more robust for torrents with large number of seeders, some UI improvements, some bug fixes, support for multi-file torrent creation, etc etc
15:08 <+zzz> BTW w00t mtg 200
15:09 < jrandom> zounds
15:09 < jrandom> ok word
15:09 < jrandom> my plans right now are just to add in the simple whispering for the floodfill peers (so people don't lose track of them as easily)
15:09 < jrandom> are there any other low hanging fruit i should address before tagging & pushing?
15:10 <+zzz> that sounds smarter than waiting for me to do it
15:10 < jrandom> oh, i should disable the old syndie too
15:11 < jrandom> (or at least its fetching)
15:11 < jrandom> i've heard some suggestions to disable theepsite tunnel by default as well - any thoughts?  yea nea?
15:11  * bar beats his not-yet-quite-dead "not have eepsite server tunnels autostart by default" horse
15:12 <+zzz> I checked in a note on localhost/syndie/ warning people it's obsolete if you want to let it go one more release, up to you
15:13 < jrandom> it might be worth keeping the content around for a while but killing the syndication
15:13 < jrandom> ok, if anyone comes up with omething else, lemmie know
15:14 <+zzz> if you do check to see if the note I added needs updating
15:14 < jadeSerpent> i agree it shouldn't start serving pages out of box, no other app does that, potential security risk
15:14 < green> Disabling default eepsite is a good idea as most people using I2P don't use it and others use user defined tunnels, you have just to look at orion stat with only ~30 sites online
15:14 < jrandom> aye
15:14 <+zzz> and ditto if you disable eepsite tunnel the instructions & default eepsite homepage need to be updated
15:15 < jrandom> it won't disable already configured tunnels, it'll just affect new users
15:15 < jrandom> true zzz
15:15 <+zzz> prob. a good idea
15:17 < green> but this is just a minor tweak not a improvemnt
15:17 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for 1) net status and 0.6.1.27?
15:17 <+zzz> resources/eepsite_index.html "your eepsite is up and running but..."
15:17 < jrandom> aye
15:19 < green> jr : Courage, let us flee!
15:19 < jrandom> ok jumping to 2) Syndie dev status
15:20 < jrandom> lots going on here, of course
15:20 < jrandom> beyond whats mentioned in the notes, once we get i2p 0.6.1.27 out i'm going to clear a bunch of the open bugs for next week's 1.004a release
15:21 <+fox> * thecrypto waves as he returns after a very very long hiatus from this project
15:21 < jrandom> anyone want to bring up anything for 2) Syndie dev status?
15:21 < jrandom> woah!
15:21 < jrandom> wb thecrypto
15:22 <+fox> <thecrypto> Thank you
15:22 < jrandom> still hacking on an i2p 0.1 sdk? :)
15:22 <+zzz> back for the 200th anniversary?
15:23 <+fox> <thecrypto> I guess so :) But I'm hoping to get back up to speed on this stuff as I've been looking around at what else is out there and it all sucks :)
15:24 < jrandom> heh cool
15:24 <+fox> * thecrypto takes a seat off to the side to let the rest of the meeting proceed
15:25 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else for 2) Syndie dev status, lets jump to 3) trac.i2p.net
15:25 < jrandom> by popular (and reasonable) demand, we've migrated from the in-syndie bugtracker to a real bugtracker
15:26 < jrandom> please use it if you can to file bug reports (though bug reports filed with syndie will be automatically imported into it after a delay)
15:26  * jadeSerpent claps
15:27 <+fox> <thecrypto> Trac works very well, use it at my day job. Have you integrated CVS into it?
15:27 < jrandom> monotone (our dvcs), yes
15:27 < jrandom> https://trac.i2p.net/browser
15:28 <+fox> <thecrypto> Neat, migrated to DVCS :) Good time for me to rejoin :)
15:28 < jrandom> mos' def'
15:29 < jrandom> at the moment, the wiki is basically disabled, but might get some use at times for working through some issues
15:29 < jrandom> i'm not sure if/when it'll get used though, but we'll see
15:30 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for 3) trac.i2p.net ?
15:31 < jrandom> if not, lets jump to good ol' fashioned 4) ???
15:31 < jrandom> anyone have something else to bring up for the meeting?
15:33 <+fox> <thecrypto> Glad to be bck
15:33 < jadeSerpent> does it always get really laggy around meeting time?
15:35 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: more than usual, yeah, though not that bad (i'm @ 1.46s lag)
15:35  * jrandom winds up
15:35  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
