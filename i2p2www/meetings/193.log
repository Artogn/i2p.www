15:04 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:04  * jrandom waves</p>
15:04 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-December/001322.html</p>
15:04 < jrandom> lets jump on in to 1) net status</p>
15:05 < jrandom> no real changes here, though its good to note that stability seems quite sufficient on irc, even with long tunnels</p>
15:05 < jrandom> though, of course, thats not necessarily the case for eveyone, and can vary substantially</p>
15:05 < jrandom> but, 'tis nice to see anyway</p>
15:05 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything to bring up for 1) net status?</p>
15:07 < jrandom> if not, lets swing over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
15:07 < jrandom> lots going on here, though summarized in the mailing list post</p>
15:08 < jrandom> the new http server isn't in use on the syndie.i2p.net/archive/ archive yet, so you cant push up new messages atm, though you can pull (or, of course, run your own 'httpserv' and let people post)</p>
15:11 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything to discuss for 2) syndie dev status?</p>
15:11 < jrandom> if not, lets shimmy over to 3) ???</p>
15:12 < jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?</p>
15:16 < jrandom> if not</p>
15:16  * jrandom winds up</p>
15:16  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
