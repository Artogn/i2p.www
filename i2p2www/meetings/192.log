15:00 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 3) iToopie</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 4) ???</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:00  * jrandom waves</p>
15:00 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-December/001321.html</p>
15:01 < jrandom> (almost two hours before the meeting, too! :)</p>
15:01 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on in to 1) net status</p>
15:01 < jrandom> things are going pretty well, no big change on this front</p>
15:02  * jrandom has been connected to irc here for 20 days now, too (a record, i believe)</p>
15:03 < jrandom> not much more to add on this front though atm</p>
15:03 < jrandom> so, if there's nothing else on it, lets jump forward to 2) syndie dev status</p>
15:04 < jrandom> progress continues here, with more bits and bobs becoming workable</p>
15:04 < jrandom> its still quite rough though... "utilitarian", but graphically utilitarian ;)</p>
15:05 < jrandom> the alpha isn't imminent though, but i hope to have it ready soon</p>
15:07 < jrandom> in any case, more info as it comes about :)</p>
15:08 < jrandom> ok, lets jump briefly on over to 3) iToopie</p>
15:08 < jrandom> as mentioned in the notes, Thanks y'all!  :)</p>
15:08 < jrandom> ok, continuing on in rapid fire to 4) ???</p>
15:08 < jrandom> anyone have anything they'd like to bring up for the meeting?</p>
15:10 < jrandom> (its probably been a year or two since our last 10 minute meeting, but perhaps that's for the best)</p>
15:10 <+fox> &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Hey wow. Totally by accident I am actually present for an I2P meeting.</p>
15:11 <+fox> &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Hi mum!</p>
15:11 <+fox> &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; This is going in the logs right? :)</p>
15:11 < jrandom> heh yeah ch0 ;)</p>
15:12 <+fox> &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Because of course my mum reads I2P meeting logs...</p>
15:12 < burl> i was going to ask about the licensing but i just read the answer on www.i2p (why not gpl?)</p>
15:13 < jrandom> gpl kills babies</p>
15:13  * jrandom ducks</p>
15:13 < burl> i have to print them out for my mum. she's not very good with computers</p>
15:13 < jrandom> heheh</p>
15:14 < burl> i've been reading all about the free software movement recently. ethically it seems bang on</p>
15:14 < burl> closed source is evil :)</p>
15:14 < jrandom> good, evil, they're all the same.  what matters here is that closed source is /insecure/ ;)</p>
15:15 < jrandom> (syndie license summary @ http://syndie.i2p.net/faq.html#license less religious license info for i2p @ http://www.i2p.net/licenses )</p>
15:15 < burl> yeah, that did cross my mind too. if some evil company stole syndie and made a "better" closed version, who'd trust it?</p>
15:16 < jrandom> you can't steal whats free</p>
15:16 < burl> yeah, but i mean made changes to the source and didn't let you see them</p>
15:17 < jrandom> changes to /your copy/ of the source.  my copy of the source is still exactly as it was before, and still exactly as free ;)</p>
15:17 < jrandom> but, yeah, i understand.  disagree, but understand</p>
15:18 < jrandom> all things considered, open source&gt;&gt;closed source, and while gpl has some nasty limits, its sufficient for many things, and open enough for security</p>
15:18 < burl> because no-one would trust the closed version so it could never take over in popularity</p>
15:20 < jrandom> aye</p>
15:21 < jrandom> licence rants are always good ways to fill up 10m of meeting logs ;)</p>
15:21 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
15:23 <+fox> &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; Well if you need more meeting time - why Java?</p>
15:23 <+fox> &lt;Ch0Hag&gt; I mean ewww!</p>
15:23 < jrandom> !thwap</p>
15:24  * jrandom winds up</p>
15:24  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
