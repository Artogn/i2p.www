15:14 < jrandom> 0) hi
15:14  * jrandom waves
15:14 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001320.html
15:14 < jrandom> (sorry for the delay, small kitchen emergency)
15:14 < gott> Hello, jrandom.
15:15 < jrandom> heya gott
15:15 < jrandom> ok, lets jump in to 1) net status
15:15  * jrandom has nothing more to add for 1) net status, beyond mentioning that i've been connected to irc for 13 days now w/out discon)
15:16 < gott> I have been able to download my favourite modernist movie Metroland from the Frenchmen in #fr via i2psnark
15:16 < gott> Going at download rate of 4400 kb/s; upload around the same.
15:16 < gott> 6 peers.
15:16 < gott> Very good for the propagation of European modernist fiction.
15:16 < jrandom> !thwap
15:17 < jrandom> (or, if you are actually getting 4Mbps, both sides are using 0hop tunnels)
15:17 < gott> bytes a second.
15:18 < jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up for 1) net status?
15:20 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on over to 2) syndie dev status
15:20 < gott> Is it possible to make i2p better somehow in this regard?
15:20 < jrandom> gott: oh, you mean 4400 Bps, not kbps?
15:20 < jrandom> then i take back the 0hop tunnel thing
15:21 < jrandom> 4KBps is typical atm, and can be improved with better peer selection and congestion management
15:22 < jrandom> ok, for syndie dev status, lots of progress going on, as mentioned in the notes
15:23 < jrandom> there's still a bunch of gaps to fill, but they're largely just filling gaps, not writing new components
15:24 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev status?
15:25 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on over to 3) ??? then
15:26 < jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up in this short meeting?
15:26 < JosephLeBlanc> Do you need any money?
15:26 < JosephLeBlanc> oh for fuck sake
15:26 < JosephLeBlanc> well, do you need any money?
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> Do you want a computer?
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> Do you want beer?
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> What?
15:27 < jrandom> atm, finances are in pretty good shape, though contributions are always appreciated, of course
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> Out with it
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> Alright, then
15:27 <+zzz> post a bounty for emule client :)
15:28 < jrandom> (but if you've got money burning a hole in your poket, it'd be great to snag a mac mini for osx gui testing ;)
15:28 < jrandom> lol zzz
15:28 < JosephLeBlanc> Not everyone is a lesbian snob who has a 40 thousand dollar student loan that needs paying off
15:28 <+zzz> keep up the good work jr
15:28 < jrandom> just in case that wasn't closedshop: i appreciate the interest and support, but i won't have any time to work on a file sharing app in the future
15:29 < JosephLeBlanc> Can you implement modulus' lovesoc
15:29 < JosephLeBlanc> ?
15:29 < jrandom> thanks zzz, you as well (your services and code definitely help tons!)
15:29 <+zzz> get the baf lol
15:30  * jrandom runs to the corner
15:30  * jrandom winds up
