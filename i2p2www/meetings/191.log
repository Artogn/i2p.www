15:14 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:14 < jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
15:14 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
15:14 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
15:14 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:14  * jrandom waves</p>
15:14 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001320.html</p>
15:14 < jrandom> (sorry for the delay, small kitchen emergency)</p>
15:14 < gott> Hello, jrandom.</p>
15:15 < jrandom> heya gott</p>
15:15 < jrandom> ok, lets jump in to 1) net status</p>
15:15  * jrandom has nothing more to add for 1) net status, beyond mentioning that i've been connected to irc for 13 days now w/out discon)</p>
15:16 < gott> I have been able to download my favourite modernist movie Metroland from the Frenchmen in #fr via i2psnark</p>
15:16 < gott> Going at download rate of 4400 kb/s; upload around the same.</p>
15:16 < gott> 6 peers.</p>
15:16 < gott> Very good for the propagation of European modernist fiction.</p>
15:16 < jrandom> !thwap</p>
15:17 < jrandom> (or, if you are actually getting 4Mbps, both sides are using 0hop tunnels)</p>
15:17 < gott> bytes a second.</p>
15:18 < jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up for 1) net status?</p>
15:20 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
15:20 < gott> Is it possible to make i2p better somehow in this regard?</p>
15:20 < jrandom> gott: oh, you mean 4400 Bps, not kbps?</p>
15:20 < jrandom> then i take back the 0hop tunnel thing</p>
15:21 < jrandom> 4KBps is typical atm, and can be improved with better peer selection and congestion management</p>
15:22 < jrandom> ok, for syndie dev status, lots of progress going on, as mentioned in the notes</p>
15:23 < jrandom> there's still a bunch of gaps to fill, but they're largely just filling gaps, not writing new components</p>
15:24 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev status?</p>
15:25 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on over to 3) ??? then</p>
15:26 < jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up in this short meeting?</p>
15:26 < JosephLeBlanc> Do you need any money?</p>
15:26 < JosephLeBlanc> oh for fuck sake</p>
15:26 < JosephLeBlanc> well, do you need any money?</p>
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> Do you want a computer?</p>
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> Do you want beer?</p>
15:27 < JosephLeBlanc> What?</p>
15:27 < jrandom> atm, finances are in pretty good shape, though contributions are always appreciated, of course</p>

15:27 <+zzz> post a bounty for emule client :)</p>
15:28 < jrandom> (but if you've got money burning a hole in your poket, it'd be great to snag a mac mini for osx gui testing ;)</p>

15:28 < JosephLeBlanc> Not everyone is a lesbian snob who has a 40 thousand dollar student loan that needs paying off</p>

15:28 < jrandom> just in case that wasn't closedshop: i appreciate the interest and support, but i won't have any time to work on a file sharing app in the future</p>
