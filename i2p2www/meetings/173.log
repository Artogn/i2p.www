15:09 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 2) jrobin</p>

15:09 <@jrandom> 4) new key</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 5) ???</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:09  * jrandom waves</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-March/001271.html</p>
15:11 <@jrandom> lets jump briefly on in to 1) Net status</p>
15:12 <@jrandom> we've been a while since a release, but things still seem fairly stable.  there are some improvements coming down the pipe though, and I hope to get us a new 0.6.1.13 this week</p>
15:13 <@jrandom> anyone have any questions/comments/concerns regarding the status of the network?</p>
15:13 <+Complication> About the periodism I noticed yesterday on a freshly started node: it desynchronized itself in a few hours</p>
15:14 <@jrandom> ah cool</p>
15:14 <+Complication> Meaning, the highs and lows became a lot more random</p>
15:14 <@jrandom> I think it still may be worthwhile to jumpstart that at the beginning though</p>
15:14 <@jrandom> (for those playing at home, we're talking about the implications of the 10m rebuild period)</p>
15:15 <+Complication> Probably helps prevent tunnel failures</p>
15:15 <+Complication> I'm still observing a healthy amount of those, but haven't counted</p>
15:15 <+tethra> (thanks for the translation :)</p>
15:15 <+Complication> Aside from that, working decently here</p>
15:16 <+Complication> I think I get "as there are no inbound/outbound tunnels available" about once per 2 hours</p>
15:17 <@jrandom> hmm, on an i2phex / i2psnark / eepproxy / ircproxy / eepsite destination?</p>
15:17 <@jrandom> (its possible for clients to overload their own tunnels, which is why I ask which)</p>
15:18 <+Complication> Checking if there's a trend</p>
15:19 <+Complication> Bit of shared clients and Pycache, more of I2Phex</p>
15:20 <@jrandom> hmm ok cool, thanks</p>
15:20 <+Complication> Significantly more of I2Phex</p>
15:20 <+Complication> Might have to limit its bandwidth</p>
15:21 <+Complication> (was at default 16K)</p>
15:23 <@jrandom> ok cool, anyone have anything else for 1) Net status?</p>
15:25 <@jrandom> if not, lets shimmy on over to 2) JRobin</p>
15:26 <@jrandom> jrobin is neat.  I like it.  it was dirt easy to integrate, fairly small (177KB), fast, has a low memory overhead, and provides visualizations that are easy to understand</p>
15:27 <+Complication> Quite agreed :)</p>
15:29 <+Complication> Convenient graphs, with high enough resolution, help find oddities and help ask about them :)</p>
15:29 <@jrandom> if there are any rrdtool gurus out there, if you want to give the latest cvs a glance and see what we're doing and/or see if there are easier ways to accomplish these tasks, I'd love some advice</p>
15:30 <@jrandom> (rrdtool &lt;--&gt;jrobin info @ http://www.jrobin.org/api/jrobinandrrdtoolcompared.html)</p>
15:31 <@jrandom> (and, if someone wants, they could write a fairly small app to read netDb/routerInfo-*.dat, feed them into jrobin databases, and essentially run your own stats.i2p)</p>
15:32 <@jrandom> the in-console jrobin integration is different from the stats.i2p functionality though, as it summarizes *your* router, not all routers.  both are useful</p>
15:34 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 2) JRobin, lets swing on over to 3) biff and toopie</p>
15:34 <@jrandom> postman: wanna give us the rundown?</p>
15:34 < postman> aah yes</p>
15:35 < postman> years ago the mailservice had an irc bot called biff could notify you about new mails</p>
15:35 <+Complication> Postman's AI foundry ;P</p>
15:35 < postman> with the migration to a new platform biff became unusauble and i had no time to revamp it</p>
15:35 < postman> now it's back online again</p>
15:35 <@jrandom> (yay!)</p>
15:36 < postman> if you wish to monitor your mailbox over irc just /msg biff .help for a list of commands</p>
15:36 < postman> usage is straightforward</p>
15:36 < postman> question/errors/rants/flames -&gt; postman@mail.i2p</p>
15:36 < postman> 2.</p>
15:37 < postman> in order to cope with the (hopefully) increasing stream of newbies jr, cervantes and me thougt of a Q&A bot that can be asked for helkp on the usual daily topics and problems</p>
15:38 < postman> first draft is named toopie and will soon reside on #i2p (i2p-chat maybe too)</p>
15:38 < postman> it will hold a list of topics, and Q&A sorted by topics and indexed by keywords</p>
15:38 < postman> toopie can speak to the channel as well as privmsg with a user</p>
15:38 <+Complication> Sounds neat, though I've never seen one before :)</p>
15:39 < postman> we hope to fill its brain asap</p>
15:39 < postman> Complication: you can play with it in #irc2p (in private if you wish :))</p>
15:39 <@jrandom> and one of the good parts about it is that we can fill it up with messages on irc :)</p>
15:39 < postman> yes</p>
15:40 < postman> admins can add some lines straight from irc and make it a new q&a</p>
15:40  * tethra suggests an entry purely for the sake of TheJudge/closedshop to the effect of "No, predecessor attacks don't work."</p>
15:40 <+tethra> ;)</p>
15:40 < postman> hee</p>
15:41 < postman> there is still room for the way of structuring the informationm</p>
15:41 <@jrandom> (but they do.  though they're not a particular program you "run" to attack someone)</p>
15:41 < postman> more to come soon</p>
15:41  * postman hand back the mike</p>
15:41 <@jrandom> word, thanks postman</p>
15:42 < ashter> postman; will toopie speak in other langages too ?</p>
15:42 < postman> ashter: not (yet)</p>
15:42 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; igpay atinlay? *g*</p>
15:42 < ashter> ok</p>
15:42 < postman> ashter: the infrastructure is there ( /me planned this )</p>
15:42 <@jrandom> word</p>
15:42 < postman> ashter: it will be a version 2 feature </p>
15:42 < ashter> great, really nice thank you</p>
15:44 < postman> (thejudge makes alone 50% of alle irc disconnects today)</p>
15:45 < postman> jrandom: ok next topic</p>
15:46 <@jrandom> ok cool, anyone have anything else on 3) biff and toopie?</p>
15:46 <@jrandom> if not, lets swing on by to 4) new key</p>
15:47 <@jrandom> well, there's not really anything to add to what I posted.  new key, yadda yadda</p>
15:47 <@jrandom> ok, lets jump on over to 5) ???</p>
15:47 <+tethra> erm</p>
15:47 <@jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up?</p>
15:48 <+tethra> how does biff know you are you? :/</p>
15:48 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; tethra: you have to register</p>
15:48 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; just read what is referenced in the weekly notes :)</p>
15:48 < postman> tethra: 1.) you know your mailboxes credentials, 2. you register with an identified nick@biff</p>
15:48 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; yes :)</p>
15:48 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; what is the point to have expiring keys when you could have expiring subkeys instead?</p>
15:48 <+tethra> postman: ah, ok. thanks.</p>
15:49 <@jrandom> mihi: to compartmentalize compromise.</p>
15:50 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; you can delete expired secret subkeys from your keyring if you wish</p>
15:51 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; but I guess it is much nicer to have ppl lsign your key every year :)</p>
15:51 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; nicer in some sadistic point of view :-&gt;</p>
15:51 < postman> jrandom: now, riddle mihi this :)</p>
15:52 <@jrandom> (assuming only the subkey could be compromised)</p>
15:54 <@jrandom> in any case, anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?</p>
15:54 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; assume someone compromised your key yesterday. now he can have played a mitm and replaced the new key.</p>
15:54 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; i.e. compromise one key -&gt; compromise all future keys, isn't it</p>
15:55 <+Complication> Unless the owner uses a revocation certificate</p>
15:55 <+Complication> invalidate compromised key -&gt; invalidate future ones</p>
15:55 <@jrandom> mihi: and I could revoke the compromised key and tell you not to trust new keys</p>
15:55 <@jrandom> you now have the choice whether to trust the key change or not</p>
15:56 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; whom to believe then? :)</p>
15:56 <@jrandom> good question.  if you hear a signed revocation in the next day or two, you should discard the new key</p>
15:57 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; and if it was a subkey, you'd revoked the amin key and the subkey is automatically discarded :)</p>
15:57 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; s/amin/main/</p>
15:58 <+fox> &lt;mihi&gt; agree to disagree?</p>
15:58 <@jrandom> aye, that we can agree to ;)</p>
15:58 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else for the meeting...</p>
15:58 <+fox> * mihi hands jrandom the *baf*er (after years, just like in good old times...)</p>
16:00 <@jrandom> hehe</p>
16:00  * jrandom winds up</p>
16:00  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
