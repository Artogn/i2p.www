14:03 < jrandom> 1) 0.4.1.3</p>
14:03 < jrandom> 2) Tunnel test time, and send processing time</p>
14:03 < jrandom> 3) Streaming lib</p>
14:03 < jrandom> 4) files.i2p</p>
14:03 < jrandom> 5) ???</p>
14:03 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:03  * jrandom waves</p>
14:04 < modulus> hi hi</p>
14:04 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-October/000469.html</p>
14:04 < deer_> &lt;fidd&gt; howdy</p>
14:04 < jrandom> i didn't spend much time on the notes, so they're pretty brief</p>
14:05 < jrandom> but, c'est la vie</p>
14:05 < jrandom> moving on to 1) 0.4.1.3</p>
14:05 < jrandom> the release came out the other day and its been.. well... largely like before</p>
14:05 < jrandom> working good enough for most things, but not as reliable as we'd like</p>
14:06 < jrandom> throughput is still low, but thats a know issue to be dealt with in 0.4.2</p>
14:06 < jrandom> as mentioned in the email, I dont expect there to be any more 0.4.1.* releases</p>
14:07 < jrandom> I dont have much more to say on that - anyone have any comments / concerns?</p>
14:07 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; yes: what about the freeze-up?</p>
14:09 < jrandom> I'm not going to discount the possibility that your machine hung due to I2P, but I severely doubt it</p>
14:09 < jrandom> no one else has ever reported that happening on any platform</p>
14:09 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well...it must be related to it somehow, if not directly, IMHO</p>
14:09 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; maybe the java?</p>
14:10 < jrandom> you're on 1.5 on w2k?</p>
14:10 < jrandom> or 1.4.2_05?</p>
14:10 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; nope, 1.5</p>
14:10 < jrandom> ok</p>
14:10 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I can't exclude it's something else, ofcourse</p>
14:11 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; could be coincidence it happend two times</p>
14:11 < jrandom> well, we can discuss further how to find out the cause after the meeting if you'd like</p>
14:11 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; but the last time..I dunno...nothing much else was running, then</p>
14:11 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; 1.5 on w2k works good for me :)</p>
14:11 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; indeed, though</p>
14:11 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; isn't there a simple debug log or something?</p>
14:11 < jrandom> if it happens again, please send me wrapper.log and logs/log-router-*.txt</p>
14:11 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; that might be usefull when it freezes</p>
14:11 < jrandom> there are more logs than dirt ;)</p>
14:12 < jrandom> ok cool dinoman</p>
14:12 < jrandom> perhaps it was some interaction with your software firewall</p>
14:12 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; maybe</p>
14:12 < jrandom> but, yeah,bounce me logs if it happens again</p>
14:12 < jrandom> (please :)</p>
14:12 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well, that  it would get blocked, I would understand</p>
14:12 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; but a total freeze...dunno...was creepy</p>
14:13 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; on the bright side: I've 27/63 now</p>
14:13 < jrandom> great</p>
14:13 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have any questions/comments/concerns with 0.4.1.3?</p>
14:13 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I'll guees I'll ask Whoo to guide my through the eep thingy</p>
14:13 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; just don't use it with Sygate Personal Firewall bad bad</p>
14:13 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; why?</p>
14:14 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; crash</p>
14:14 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; yes; you forgot 6) profit!!</p>
14:14 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:14 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; crash?</p>
14:14 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ermm</p>
14:14 < jrandom> dinoman: it crashes your OS?  the firewall?  I2P?</p>
14:14 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well, wouldn't that explain it, then? ;-)</p>
14:15 < jrandom> newsbyte: are you running Sygate Personal Firewall?</p>
14:15 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; indeed</p>
14:15 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well, not on my router</p>
14:15 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; but on the puter, yes</p>
14:15 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; seems we're on to something</p>
14:16 < deer_> &lt;DrWoo&gt; newsbyte: /join #i2p-chat so jrandom can get through his meeting</p>
14:16 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; though it doesn't crash/freeze immediately, apperently</p>
14:16 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; os it crashes windows</p>
14:16 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ?</p>
14:16 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; jrand is already here</p>
14:16 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; sorry looked away</p>
14:16 < jrandom> ok, perhaps we can look into what SPF is b0rking on</p>
14:16 < jrandom> if there's nothing else on 0.4.1.3, moving on to 2) Tunnel test time, and send processing time</p>
14:17 < jrandom> there was some discussion yesterday exploring some of the timeouts, and basically things just occationally take too long</p>
14:17 < jrandom> i dont think the spikes you can see in http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/processingTime.png are legitimate though</p>
14:18 < jrandom> well, they're real - it really does take that long</p>
14:18 < jrandom> what i mean is, we should be able to get rid of them</p>
14:18 < jrandom> some queueing is going to happen, but if we are more careful with what we accept, we should be able to reduce it</p>
14:19 < jrandom> the delays are also likely due to some occational spikes in job processing time, which we can tune the fsck out of</p>
14:20 < jrandom> in general though, the message queueing seems all right, even if it spikes up some tunnel tests</p>
14:20 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; darn..I wish freenet and i2p could really merge...seems like progress would be a lot faster, possibly beneficial to both</p>
14:20 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; yeah, I don't see why fsck would be useful for jon processing :)</p>
14:20 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; s/jon/job/</p>
14:21 < jrandom> there is much potential for collaboration, but the two projects have very different aims</p>
14:21 < jrandom> !thwap Ragnarok</p>
14:21 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ermm</p>
14:21 < jrandom> oh, one thing I mentioned yesterday </p>
14:21 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I don't think the projects' goals, however, are all that different...</p>
14:22 < deer_> &lt;DrWoo&gt; jrandom: technical goals</p>
14:22 < jrandom> newsbyte: we can discuss that in 5) ??? or later if you prefer, we're on 2) right now</p>
14:22 < deer_> &lt;DrWoo&gt; oops newsbyte: technical goals</p>
14:22 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; hehe</p>
14:22 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; yes, and 3)profit! according to /. traditions!</p>
14:22 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; :-)</p>
14:22 < deer_> &lt;Demokritos&gt; I can't believe Tor is not backwards compatible from 0.0.8 to 0.0.8.1</p>
14:23 < jrandom> with the tunnel testing, there is a floor to the test period - currently set to 5 seconds by default</p>
14:23 < jrandom> the previous release had a hard limit of 30 seconds, but you can configure your own tunnel test time by updating http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp and adding "router.tunnelTestMinimum=10000" (or whatever - that value is in milliseconds)</p>
14:23 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; those seconds, are they alchimagical?</p>
14:24 < jrandom> the 5s default should be fine though</p>
14:24 < deer_> &lt;Demokritos&gt; I actually upgraded Tor the day before yesterday because it stopped working, and now the network is telling me again, I have a non compatible version... what the.. </p>
14:24 < deer_> &lt;Demokritos&gt; oh... hello everyone :)</p>
14:24 < jrandom> newsbyte: the tunnel test time is MAX(avgTunnelTestTime*2, minTunnelTestTime)</p>
14:25 < jrandom> (we have the minTunnelTestTime because otherwise a series of fast tests could cause a cascading failure)</p>
14:26 < jrandom> more details can be found in http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/history.txt?rev=HEAD</p>
14:26 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; hmm</p>
14:26 < deer_> &lt;Demokritos&gt; this is really funny... a job agency wants me to use Internet Explorer, otherwise I'm not able to register an application</p>
14:27 < jrandom> *cough* y'all realize these meeting logs go on the web, right?  :)</p>
14:27 < deer_> &lt;Demokritos&gt; &lt;-- not too good in english</p>
14:27 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; they do?!</p>
14:27 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; Hi mum!</p>
14:27 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:27 < deer_> &lt;Demokritos&gt; um, sorry. .I'm disturbing the meeting.. I'm off</p>
14:28 < jrandom> naw, please stay, but discuss i2p stuff ;)</p>
14:28 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; don't worry; disturbing is an art, just keep an eye on me, and you'll learn</p>
14:28 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:28 < jrandom> ok, anything else on 2) Tunnel test time, and send processing time ?</p>
14:28 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; focus people</p>
14:29 -!- znation [~znation@ip68-226-31-250.tc.ph.cox.net] has quit [Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)]</p>
14:29 < jrandom> if not, moving on to 3) Streaming lib</p>
14:29 < jrandom> as mentioned in the status notes, lots of progress</p>
14:29 -!- znation [~znation@ip68-226-31-250.tc.ph.cox.net] has joined #i2p</p>
14:29 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; done by you?</p>
14:29 < jrandom> still not there yet, but I hope to be doing some live tests in the next week</p>
14:30 < jrandom> i've been working on the streaming lib, yeah</p>
14:30 < jrandom> i finally got it ping()ing earlier today ;)</p>
14:30 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; nice :)</p>
14:31 < jrandom> ok, i dont really have anything else to add about that</p>
14:31 < jrandom> anyone have any questions / comments / concerns?</p>
14:31 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ermm...speed?</p>
14:31 < jrandom> speed is fine</p>
14:31 < deer_> &lt;baffled&gt; what type of speed up/through put do you expect?</p>
14:31 < jrandom> i expect significant throughput improvements</p>
14:32 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; he expects a fine, he said</p>
14:32 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; for speeding</p>
14:32 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:32 < jrandom> in addition, for small request/response connections, the latency will be dramatically reduced</p>
14:32 < jrandom> (cut in half)</p>
14:32 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; wow</p>
14:32 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; is that using udp?</p>
14:33 < jrandom> the new lib exposes all the neat tunable parameters for normal TCP stacks too, so apps will be able to tweak out their own setup</p>
14:33 < jrandom> no dinoman, this works on top of i2p's I2CP</p>
14:33 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; wow x2</p>
14:33 < jrandom> (though we'll be writing similar code in a month or so to get the UDP transport..)</p>
14:34 < jrandom> but, well, we'll see.</p>
14:34 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; because...?</p>
14:34 < jrandom> there's still a lot of work to do</p>
14:34 < jrandom> because what?</p>
14:34 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well, can't tcp do it as well?</p>
14:35 < jrandom> oh, why we're going to go UDP?  http://www.i2p.net/todo#transport</p>
14:35 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I remember the same discussion on freenet too, but they sticked to tcp as yet</p>
14:35 < jrandom> plus TCP is a general purpose streaming transport - we can dramatically simplify it, since we can put up with a certain degree of out of order</p>
14:35 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; not that all decisions they make are good ;-)</p>
14:36 < jrandom> newsbyte: i've followed those discussions and we're going to go udp</p>
14:36 < jrandom> (that doesnt mean freenet is wrong - they've got different constraints)</p>
14:37 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; i2p should not be compared too closely to freenet.  They're very different technically.</p>
14:37 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; (or: they ARE wrong ;-)</p>
14:37 < jrandom> i dont think their use of TCP right now is wrong, just as I dont think I2P's previous use of TCP is wrong.  progress requires small steps</p>
14:38 < deer_> &lt;mule_iip&gt; newsbyte makes sure the meetings don't get too short</p>
14:38 < jrandom> heh</p>
14:38 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; yeah, nothing worse then short meetings</p>
14:38 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; you can't eat all the popcorn and drink all the beer, then</p>
14:38 < jrandom> ok, anything else on 3) Streaming lib ?</p>
14:39 < jrandom> if not, 4) files.i2p</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; I think we're cool</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well, I know I am</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; and funny too</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; most of the time</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; and also annoying</p>
14:39 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:39 < jrandom> well, i just wanted to point out files.i2p - a new search engine on i2p</p>
14:40 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ah, I see</p>
14:40 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I was hoping it would be about putting eepsites up</p>
14:40 < jrandom> one interesting thing to note is that you can reach eepsites that aren't up anymore with it, since it caches</p>
14:41 < deer_> &lt;baffled&gt; does it cache everything?</p>
14:41 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; all searchengines thusfar are server-side?</p>
14:41 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; interesting.  Shouldn't be too hard, these days :).</p>
14:41 < jrandom> baffled: caches text/html from what i can tell</p>
14:42 < deer_> &lt;mule_iip&gt; at least it has limits on file size and types, so won't cache movies</p>
14:42 < deer_> &lt;baffled&gt; Auh, that's what I thought not binary.</p>
14:42 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I mean, they are not in js, I suppose?</p>
14:43 < jrandom> it uses nutch if anyone wants to look into it further.  or i'm sure we'll get the site author to put up a feedback form or something ;)</p>
14:43 < jrandom> newsbyte: correct, this is just a normal website hosted anonymously</p>
14:43 < jrandom> the site contains a search engine (like google)</p>
14:44 < jrandom> anyway, i just wanted to mention it</p>
14:44 < jrandom> there have also been a lot of blogs popping up lately, which imho is really cool</p>
14:44 < jrandom> my 'eep' bookmark folder almost fills a screen :)</p>
14:44 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; hehe, myi2p is happening all by itself :)</p>
14:45 < jrandom> you just have to bring up the sore points, dont ya ragnarok?  ;)</p>
14:45 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; sorry :)</p>
14:46 < jrandom> ok, anyone have any questions/comments/concerns wrt files.i2p?</p>
14:46 < jrandom> if not, let me move on to 4.1) biff</p>
14:46  * jrandom almost forgot biff</p>
14:46 < jrandom> postman, you arond?</p>
14:47 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I think he's biffed up</p>
14:47 < jrandom> well, if not, biff is this new kickass mail notification bot</p>
14:47 < jrandom> if you've got an email acct at mail.i2p, you can tell biff to notify you when you get new mail</p>
14:47 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; does it has archives?</p>
14:48 < jrandom> newsbyte: biff is just a notification bot, the mail is stored on the mail server (and accessed with your normal mail reader - kmail, etc)</p>
14:48 < jrandom> see http://www.postman.i2p/</p>
14:49 < jrandom> ok, so, yeah, go to the eepsite or check out #mail.i2p over there</p>
14:49 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I will, as soon as I get my eepsite on</p>
14:49  * jrandom doesnt really know much more wrt biff - redirect any questions to postman</p>
14:50 < jrandom> instead, we can move on to 5) ???</p>
14:50 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; indeed</p>
14:50 < jrandom> does anyone have anything else they want to bring up?</p>
14:50 < deer_> * mule_iip raising hand to get voice: would like to recall my persistent FCP over I2P problems. but probably that can wait and will automagically be solved by 0.4.2.</p>
14:50 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; yes, and the freeze</p>
14:50 < jrandom> i hope so mule_iip</p>
14:50 < deer_> &lt;mule_iip&gt; ok, will be your test platform :)</p>
14:50 < jrandom> newsbyte: is there anything we need to discuss about it?  could you just email me your logs if it happens again?</p>
14:51 < jrandom> ooh mule, that'd rule</p>
14:51  * jrandom will definitelytake you up on that</p>
14:51 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well...can i still send those, if everything is frozen?</p>
14:51 < jrandom> the files are written to disk.  </p>
14:51 < jrandom> when you restart, send me the logs</p>
14:51 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I mean, in that case, I could send it now, since they should be somewhere </p>
14:51 < jrandom> (please)</p>
14:51 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; i was in the forum and see that the jabber service is gone. was thaat of us to anyone if it was i would like to run one if it would be cool?</p>
14:51 < jrandom> the files rotate though newsbyte</p>
14:52 < jrandom> duck and demonic_1 have had jabber servers at various times, but it seems most of the i2p IM activity has been on irc</p>
14:52 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; the files rotate? surely it stores quite some data before it starts deleting?</p>
14:53 < jrandom> newsbyte: ok, send me your logs, maybe it has something in it</p>
14:53 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; good</p>
14:53 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ermm</p>
14:54 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; darn</p>
14:54 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; a lot of .logs</p>
14:54 < deer_> &lt;dinoman&gt; ok</p>
14:54 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; a noob is never gonna follow this</p>
14:54 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I guess you're right in not making a /. article yet</p>
14:55 < jrandom> we're in no rush</p>
14:55 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; log-router.txt?</p>
14:55 < jrandom> wrapper.log and logs/log-router-*.txt</p>
14:56 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; and the mailaddy to use would be...?</p>
14:56 < deer_> &lt;fidd&gt; dinoman, a jabber server would be cool imo</p>
14:56 < jrandom> jrandom@i2p.net</p>
14:56 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; accessible by i2p, I hope?</p>
14:56 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; ;-)</p>
14:56 < jrandom> newsbyte: you can put your logs on your eepsite and msg me the url</p>
14:57 < jrandom> or you can send mail to jrandom@mail.i2p</p>
14:57 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; indeed!</p>
14:57 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; a good idea!</p>
14:57 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; there is only one little problem with it: It's not up yet</p>
14:57 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything they want to bring up?</p>
14:57 < jrandom> well, we can work on that newsbyte</p>
14:57 < jrandom> (after the meeting)</p>
14:59 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; thnks, but whoo is already helping</p>
14:59 < jrandom> if there's nothing else...</p>
14:59 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; we need a detailed howto/wiki/helpsite/something, though</p>
14:59  * jrandom winds up</p>
14:59 < deer_> &lt;Jake_&gt; i'd like to say, for the meeting, if a public release of i2p can be made before the u.s. election on november 2nd, this would go a long way to helping ensure a stable democracy </p>
14:59 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; what about 6)?</p>
14:59 < jrandom> newsbyte: would you like to work on that?</p>
15:00 < jrandom> newsbyte: i do agree it'd be great to get some more howtos and help info</p>
15:00 < deer_> &lt;Ragnarok&gt; 6) There is no.... number 6</p>
15:00 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; well, yeah, sort of, but it's a strange thing, with me</p>
15:00 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I'm pro-wiki and public thingy and free for everyone and all that</p>
15:00 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; but my ego protests and wants minimal control</p>
15:00 < jrandom> great</p>
15:00 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; go figger</p>
15:00 < jrandom> heh</p>
15:01 < jrandom> well, if you'd like to make your own eepsite into a wiki you control, that'd be great too</p>
15:01 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; indeed</p>
15:01 < jrandom> though ugha.i2p has a pretty good uptime</p>
15:01 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; I'll think about it</p>
15:01 < jrandom> cool</p>
15:02 < deer_> &lt;newsbyte&gt; 6 would be the freenet-i2p thingy</p>
15:02  * jrandom winds up </p>
15:02  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed </p>
