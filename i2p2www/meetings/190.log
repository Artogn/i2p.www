15:02 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:02 < jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
15:02 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
15:02 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
15:02 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:02  * jrandom waves</p>
15:02 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-November/001319.html</p>
15:03 < jrandom> since that one is pretty short, lets jump on in to 1) net status</p>
15:04 < jrandom> things are looking pretty good atm, network seems pretty steady</p>
15:04 <+zzz> I invented a "peer capacity index"</p>
15:04 <+zzz> on the dashboard...</p>
15:04 <+zzz> so far not sure it is helpful though</p>
15:04 < jrandom> ah yeah, sorry, metioned that one last week - looks quite useful, thanks!</p>
15:05 < jrandom> interesting to see the disparity out there so clarly</p>
15:05 <+zzz> the idea is the ratio of high-cap routers to low-cap routers, which is obviously important to tunnel build %</p>
15:06 <+zzz> I'm removing routers from stats that I don't get a netdb update for in 1.5 hours but that seems too quick, I think it is skewing the stats</p>
15:07 < jrandom> ah, ok, that would explain it.  are you still harvesting?</p>
15:07 < jrandom> (or wget'ing from dev.i2p.net?)</p>
15:08 <+zzz> yes</p>
15:08 < jrandom> cool</p>
15:08 <+zzz> netDb.harvestDirectly=false</p>
15:08 <+zzz>   netDb.shouldHarvest=true, right?</p>
15:09 < jrandom> so the stats we've had before were largely based on routers that were so bad the user shut them down & disapeared then?</p>
15:09 < jrandom> right</p>
15:10 <+zzz> it's always been 1.5 hours, but plotting the M/N/O routers, they seem to come and go when intuitively they should stay pretty constant</p>
15:10 < jrandom> ah ok</p>
15:10 <+zzz> you can see spikes/dips in all the data that last 1.5 hours :)</p>
15:11 < spaetz> net seems pretty stable. Yep</p>
15:12 <+zzz> thats all I have for that topic</p>
15:12 < spaetz> I'd like to know if jrandom completely focuses on syndie nowadays or if he still looks at i2p dev.</p>
15:12 < spaetz> or if this is just a bit on hte backburner temporarily</p>
15:13  * jrandom completely focuses on syndie nowadays, but will work on i2p both when there are problems and once syndie is established</p>
15:13  * spaetz thanks for the information</p>
15:14  * spaetz is fine with this</p>
15:15 < jrandom> w3wt.  yeah, steadystate means syndie dev can continue, but if there are problems, of course i reprioritize</p>
15:15 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else on 1) net status?</p>
15:15 < Walter> I have a random question.</p>
15:15 < jrandom> hit me Walter </p>
15:17 < Walter> Assume you have 100Mb/s BW, what kind of server would you need to saturate it as an I2P node?</p>
15:17 < jrandom> doesnt matter</p>
15:17 < jrandom> i2p does not and will not saturate 100Mbps</p>
15:18 < Walter> Assume one wanted to make use of available BW.</p>
15:18 < jrandom> you would not.</p>
15:19 < spaetz> I've got 150kbs up and down and it uses like 25% of a vserver (Dell shared with a dozen others)</p>
15:19 < jrandom> that exceeds the capacity of the entire network</p>
15:19 < spaetz> 25%CPU that is</p>
15:19  * spaetz admits that's not really a precise answer and shuts up</p>
15:20 < jrandom> the routers themselves have a mem v. throughput tradeoff, making it less likely that a router can even push &gt; 3-350KBps</p>
15:20 < jrandom> (of course, that tradeoff can be tweake to allow higher rates, but thats not an issue)</p>
15:21 < jrandom> using bandwidth is *BAD* unless that bandwidth is being used only when necessary</p>
15:22 <+zzz> the network is averaging about 1.5 MBps (=12 Mbps) total traffic over the last 3 months</p>
15:23 < Walter> I see.</p>
15:24 <+fox> &lt;LeerokKitchen&gt; Field trip!</p>
15:26 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else for 1) net status, lets jump on over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
15:26 < jrandom> progress here continues, and i've been doing testing both on windows and linux</p>
15:28 < jrandom> current battle is on the forum management interface, though since the text interface is already embedded, all functionality is already in place</p>
15:29 < jrandom> not much more news to discuss on that front though</p>
15:30 < jrandom> anyone have any questions/comments/concerns on 2) syndie dev status?</p>
15:33 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on to 3) ???</p>
15:33 < jrandom> y'all have anything else for the meeting?</p>
15:34 <+fox> &lt;blx&gt; when will gpl java be usable with i2p=</p>
15:34 <+fox> &lt;blx&gt; ?</p>
15:35 < Complication3> I guess it depends on when gpl java will be usable on various distros</p>
15:35 < Complication3> Or available for download from Sun</p>
15:36 < Complication3> But it feels like a moot point, since it's the same Java which is usable already now</p>
15:36 < Complication3> GPL would only let it be packaged more conveniently, and improved upon</p>
15:37 < jrandom> (and i2p already works with gcj/kaffe, though not all of the client apps)</p>
15:37  * Complication3 quickly reads backlog</p>
15:37 < jrandom> ((and syndie works with gcj/kaffe completely))</p>
15:38 <+fox> &lt;blx&gt; Compilation, thats what they want you to think ;)</p>
15:38 <+fox> &lt;blx&gt; but ok, i got my question answered.</p>
15:38 <+fox> &lt;blx&gt; Complication even. misread</p>
15:39 < Complication3> blx: well, the sources are available already now, it's just that few read and compile them</p>
15:39 < jrandom> (and you can even modify and use those modifications, you just can't distribute your mods)</p>
15:40 < koff> when will i2p have the logging functionality suggested by the proposed laws i heard about?</p>
15:41 < jrandom> never</p>
15:41 <+zzz> hahahaha</p>
15:41  * Complication3 suspects never :)</p>
15:41 <+fox> &lt;blx&gt; what laws?</p>
15:41  * jrandom assumes you refer to .de/.eu data retention issues</p>
15:41 < Complication3> Someone in the forum talked of a (proposed) law in Germany</p>
15:42 < jrandom> (and then the .us ones in a few years)</p>
15:42 < Complication3> They could have spelled it out better though</p>
15:42 < jrandom> aye, 'tis just proposed, but not a big suprise</p>
15:43 < Complication3> I personally think: it's not like data retention laws aren't being broken left and right already</p>
15:43 < Complication3> Breaking a dozen more of them? I personally wouldn't care much...</p>
15:44 < Complication3> In short, I want to see how they're going to enforce it</p>
15:44 < tea> like they did with napster : arrest everyone</p>
15:45 < Complication3> If they manage to make a good try, something will need to be found to thwart that ("not in my country" peering principle for countries where insanity prevails)</p>
15:45 <+fox> &lt;LeerokLacerta&gt; That reminds me of a song.</p>
15:45 <+fox> &lt;LeerokLacerta&gt; http://2ch.ru/mu/src/1163070550597.mp3</p>
15:46 < tea> turning all data traffic over to anonymous networks might help ...</p>
15:47 < Complication3> Just ignoring them en masse has worked for plain ordinary pirates...</p>
15:47 < Complication3> You can arrest one person ignoring you. Can't do that with several hundred thousand.</p>
15:47 < tea> that's no argument for a german :)</p>
15:47 <+fox> &lt;modulus&gt; you can</p>
15:47 <+fox> &lt;modulus&gt; hitler did</p>
15:48 < Complication3> That's only because nobody bothered removing him</p>
15:48 < jrandom> *cough*</p>
15:48 < Complication3> Had they taken up arms, it wouldn't have worked</p>
15:48 < Complication3> (sorry, far off topic, yes)</p>
15:48 < tea> still, one does feel important in being paranoid</p>
15:48 <+fox> &lt;modulus&gt; that said i think i2p could comply with data retention laws without damaging anonimity, but there's no reason to do that.</p>
15:48 < jrandom> ok, well, i think we've addressed the i2p-related issue there ;)</p>
15:48 < tea> sry</p>
15:49 < jrandom> aye modulus</p>
15:49 < jrandom> (we already assume individual users are logging everything anyway, as are the isps)</p>
15:49 <+fox> &lt;modulus&gt; right, so a DR-enabled i2p wouldn't be the end of the world</p>
15:51 < Complication3> Someone would have to bother forking that, though... :P</p>
15:52  * jrandom keeps my mouth shut ;)</p>
15:52 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
15:53 < jrandom> if not</p>
15:53  * jrandom winds up</p>
15:53  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
