00:01 < mids> Tue Dec  3 23:01:00 UTC 2002
00:01 < mids> Welcome everybody
00:02 < mids> today we are going to talk about nice websites
00:02 < mids> atleast, until nop comes back in 8 minutes
00:02 < mids> now here comes my nice website:
00:02 < hezekiah> lol
00:02 < mids> http://www.longbets.org/
00:02 < mids> "The purpose of the Long Bet Foundation is to improve long-term thinking"
00:03 < mids> consult the website for more information
00:03 < mids> .
00:03 < hezekiah> mids ... you need to take a course at an MC camp about "filling dead air."
00:03 < hezekiah> How's RC3? Do you know?
00:03 < mids> 1) you take a bottle of air
00:03 < mids> 2) you fill it with water
00:03 < mids> 3) the dead air is filled.
00:03 < mids> .
00:03 < hezekiah> Any feedback on the "pre" RC3?
00:04 < mids> someone asked how the upgrade could be done
00:04 < mids> otherwise no comments that I can remember
00:05 < mids> codeshark made some commits for the windows version of rc3 to CVS
00:05 < mids> like said last weeks: rc3 is near
00:05 < mids> only we lack developertime to release it :)
00:06 < hezekiah> The configure script should now support Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. If you want to try it, check out the "development" branch of CVS and give it a whirl!
00:06 < mids> I tried it
00:06 < mids> but I got all kind of errors
00:06 < hezekiah> When did you try it?
00:06 < mids> 3 days ago
00:06 < hezekiah> Hmmm ... what operating system?
00:06 < mids> linux
00:07 < hezekiah> Odd. Send me the errors.
00:07 < hezekiah> I'll look into it.
00:08 < mids> ./configure works fine... but takes quite long actually
00:08 < mids> compared with other opensource projects
00:08 < hezekiah> Hmm ... it should take only a minute or so.
00:08 < mids> yeah
00:08 < mids> but longer as other projects with the same size
00:09 < hezekiah> Do they have to do crypto?
00:09 < hezekiah> That can make a big difference. (A fair section of the time is spent finding OpenSSL, and finding integer types and making macros for them.)
00:09 < mids> hm nope
00:09 < mids> it compiles now
00:09 < hezekiah> Good! :)
00:09 < mids> but it refuses to bind to port 6667
00:10 < mids> is the configuration file format changed?
00:10 < hezekiah> It should.
00:10 < mids> oh wait
00:10 < hezekiah> You already have isproxy running on port 6667 since your talking to me. (Unless you customized the isproxy you ran before.)
00:10 < mids> it is this NASTY timeout
00:10 < mids> that should really be fixed...
00:11 < mids> it works
00:11 < hezekiah> The timeout that occures when a copy of isproxy bombs out with the port still bound?
00:11 < mids> hip hip
00:11 < hezekiah> hurra!
00:11 < mids> yeah that timeout
00:11 < hezekiah> Ugh. You're right.
00:11 < mids> .
00:11 < mids> Other question that I got through some user:
00:12 < hezekiah> Well, that's the current state in developerland from my view folks! More at 11:00!
00:12 < hezekiah> What?
00:12 < mids> why does the entropy generation feed directly from the keypresses?
00:12 < mids> and not from /dev/random like GnuPG etc do?
00:12 < hezekiah> I don't know. UserX?
00:12 < mids> /dev/random uses mouse, network and other randomness too
00:13 < hezekiah> (Well, /dev/random doesn't use network if you say not to in the kernel; ... which I do.)
00:13 < mids> depens on the os I think
00:14 < mids> .
00:14 < UserX> reason for that is not all /dev/randoms produce secure random data
00:15 < hezekiah> Ah ...
00:15 < mids> UserX: then how does GnuPG handle it? I am sure they do it right :)
00:15 < hezekiah> Maybe we should make it check to see if the system does ... and use it if so.
00:16 < UserX> mids: i'm not sure. i'll look into that
00:16 < hezekiah> If it's in their configure script, then I might be able to find it.
00:16 < mids> great
00:16 < mids> I _really_ need to sleep now
00:17 < hezekiah> Bye, mids! :
00:17 < hezekiah> :)
00:17 < mids> night
00:17 < hezekiah> 'night.
00:17 < mids> (logfiles on http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/iip/)
00:18 < hezekiah> (Meanwhile, our reports are still investigating the mysterious dissapearence of "nop"! We'll give you the breaking news "as it happens (r)!")
00:18 < hezekiah> [If no one has noticed yet, I'll be the first to admit: I don't do well at filling dead air.]
00:19 < hezekiah> I would like to officially thank the person who submitted a logo to the iip-dev mailing list.
00:19 < hezekiah> It's the best one I've seen yet. (Note: It's also the only one I've seen yet ...)
00:20 < hezekiah> Well, while we wait for nop ...
00:20 < hezekiah> ... Does anyone have question!?
00:21 < hezekiah> Anyone?
00:21 < hezekiah> Anyone at all?
00:21 < pox> bpb was writing a license.  did it materialize?
00:22 < hezekiah> I wasn't aware of any license in the works. Currently, I beleive is IIP licensed under the GPL.
00:23 < hezekiah> Yup. IIP is licensed under the GPL
00:23 < nop> hi
00:23 < nop> ok
00:23 < nop> sorry
00:23 < hezekiah> The man is HERE!
00:24 < nop> alright
00:24 < nop> rc3 should be coming out today
00:24 < nop> it's getting tested as we speak
00:24 < hezekiah> Yay!
00:25 < nop> other than that
00:25 < nop> I don't think there's much to say this week
00:25 < nop> rather slow week
00:25 < nop> busy for most people
00:25 < nop> side note
00:25 < nop> life is good
00:25 < nop> :)
00:25 < nop> any questions
00:25 < nop> comments
00:26 < nop> .
00:26 < hezekiah> When can we expect IIP 1.1 final to be out?
00:27 < nop> hezekiah you tell me ;)
00:27 < nop> j/k
00:27 < nop> probably a few weeks after rc3 is released today
00:27 < hezekiah> I'm working on 1.2 development!
00:27 < nop> haha
00:27 < hezekiah> OK. :)
00:27 < nop> I know
00:27 < nop> I'm kidding
00:27 < hezekiah> You would!
00:27 < hezekiah> lo
00:27 < nop> pending bugs etc
00:27 < hezekiah> lol
00:30 < hezekiah> Does any else have a question?
00:30 < nemesis> hm...
00:31 < nemesis> plan codeshark a tut for fileserv?
00:40 < hezekiah> Well ... I'm off. Have fun everyone. ;-)
