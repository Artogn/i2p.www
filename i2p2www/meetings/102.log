14:04 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:04 < jrandom> 1) 0.3.4.1 status</p>
14:04 < jrandom> 2) Updated docs</p>
14:04 < jrandom> 3) 0.4 progress</p>
14:04 < jrandom> 4) ???</p>
14:04 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:04  * jrandom waves</p>
14:04 < jrandom> weekly status notes just posted a few seconds ago @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-August/000404.html</p>
14:04 < deer> &lt;mrflibble&gt; ooh</p>
14:04  * jrandom will give y'all a sec to pull those up ;)</p>
14:05 < jrandom> anyway, while y'all are reading, might as well swing into 1) 0.3.4.1 status</p>
14:05 < jrandom> 0.3.4.1 is out, as you've seen</p>
14:06 < jrandom> its only been a day or two though, but its generally seemed to be going pretty well, at least, up through a few hours ago</p>
14:07 < jrandom> there are a pair of bugs just recently tracked down (and fixed locally, testing ongoing), and those are pretty substantial, so we'll be seeing a new release in a day or two</p>
14:07 < jrandom> has anyone had any problems with the new web console?</p>
14:07 < jrandom> (or, more specifically, has anyone tried it and had problems?  :)(</p>
14:07 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Tried it, work well ^^</p>
14:07 < jrandom> w3rd</p>
14:08 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Even without any Java compiler ^^</p>
14:08 < jrandom> nice, yeah, it should precompile all the JSPs so people won't need javac</p>
14:08 < jrandom> thats one thing that web app devs will need to do, but its really really easy, especially with ant</p>
14:09 < jrandom> (template code to do it is in i2p/apps/routerconsole/java/build.xml in the 'precompilejsp' target)</p>
14:09 < deer> &lt;identiguy&gt; jrandom, what are your concerns about outproxies?</p>
14:09 < jrandom> i've also added in optional basic HTTP authentication to protect the console, so you'll be able to have it listen on 0.0.0.0 and access it remotely</p>
14:10 < jrandom> oh, my concerns w/ outproxies are threefold - the cost (technical and social) of maangement, the security (outproxies get cleartext), and the anonymity (when you leave a mixnet, you are much more vulnerable to attack)</p>
14:10 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; The servlet console misses a few stats from :7655 (memory consumption), and may some other stuff (shitlist), but it's great ^^</p>
14:11 < deer> &lt;identiguy&gt; Thanks. Just wondering.</p>
14:11 < jrandom> "private" outproxies are different though - e.g. an anonymizer.i2p could work great without requiring trust</p>
14:11 < jrandom> (but still limiting access to pseudonymously known clients, etc)</p>
14:12 < jrandom> ah right oOo, I'm going to add in a new page that mirrors the old one</p>
14:12 < jrandom> or would you suggest a new page for more stats?  could you draft up what you'd like it to look like?</p>
14:12 < jrandom> (or even code it?  :)</p>
14:12 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Well, it could have been left as an exrcercice for the reader ;)</p>
14:12 < jrandom> lol</p>
14:13 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; I was only thinking of memory consumption (on main page) and a Shitlist tab, that's all _I_ miss</p>
14:13 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Might need to add shitlist reason to shitlisting, BTW ;)</p>
14:13 < jrandom> we could probably toss the detailed shitlist into the peer profile page</p>
14:14 < jrandom> we dont actually keep track of that right now, but you're right, we could and it'd be nice</p>
14:14 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; IMHO the peer profile page is too big to be really usefull :*)</p>
14:14 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; And easy to do, every code to .addshitlist() stuff have good comments just the next line ;)</p>
14:14 < jrandom> any suggestions on improvement?</p>
14:15 < jrandom> heh :)</p>
14:15 < jrandom> (the netDb page imho is pretty nasty)</p>
14:16 < jrandom> hi fvw </p>
14:16 < fvw> heyas jrandom, everyone.</p>
14:16 < jrandom> ok, well, if anyone has any more suggestions for the web side, please let me know</p>
14:16 < jrandom> this new web console is really just a first pass at things, and most of my attention has been paid to the configuration side</p>
14:17 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up wrt 0.3.4.1?</p>
14:17 < jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) Updated docs</p>
14:17 < jrandom> [see email for list of updated pages]</p>
14:18 < jrandom> we've finally gotten all the details out of the paypal/e-gold accts as well (sorry for the delay!)</p>
14:19 < cervantes> w00t</p>
14:19 < jrandom> another aspect of the docs not mentioned is what we should ship with the router - on the new web console, we can easily package up any html / jsp files to serve as context sensitive help</p>
14:19 < cervantes> sheeeit....did I really donate all that</p>
14:20 < jrandom> cervantes definitely gets the cervantes++ this week :)</p>
14:20 < cervantes> must have miscounted my foreign currency ;-)</p>
14:20 < jrandom> lol</p>
14:20  * fvw cheers for cervantes.</p>
14:20 < jrandom> mos def</p>
14:20 < cervantes> btw I've found an old stash of hungarian dollars....</p>
14:21 < jrandom> lol do you keep these under your mattress or something?</p>
14:21 < cervantes> or forints ..</p>
14:21 < cervantes> I always overestimate my holiday spending ;-)</p>
14:21 < jrandom> heh</p>
14:22 < fvw> hmm, forints. How odd.</p>
14:22  * fvw mumbles "forinti=0..."</p>
14:23 < jrandom> (no wonder hungarian notation doesn't use 'i')</p>
14:23 < jrandom> &lt;/derail&gt;</p>
14:23 < fvw> hehe. Yes, getting back on track. New docs. very pretty.</p>
14:23 < jrandom> w3rd</p>
14:23 < deer> &lt;kling&gt; g`evening </p>
14:24 < jrandom> there is still much to be cleaned up, so hopefully people can take a page or two and give it a once over, sending in your results / updates</p>
14:24 < jrandom> hi kling</p>
14:24 < jrandom> ok, anything else wrt docs?</p>
14:24 < fvw> pweh</p>
14:25 < jrandom> if not, moving on to 3) 0.4 progress</p>
14:25 < fvw> perhaps not totally on topic, but the download page needs some work too.</p>
14:25 < jrandom> ah</p>
14:25 < jrandom> yeah</p>
14:25 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Missings Bounties deatails ? ;)</p>
14:25 < jrandom> that particular page i'm not /too/ worried about, since it'll all be changing with the new installer, so we'll have to rewrite it anyway</p>
14:25 < fvw> I'll kick it a bit and ask the necessary questions on the mailinglist.</p>
14:25 < jrandom> r0x0r fvw</p>
14:25 < fvw> oh, ok. Then I won't,.</p>
14:26 < deer> &lt;kling&gt; router still up nothing special to report Uptime 32h</p>
14:26 < jrandom> yeah, we'll still have some of that info, but most will change</p>
14:26 < jrandom> nice kling - are you on 0.3.4.1 or 0.3.4?</p>
14:26 < deer> &lt;kling&gt; .1</p>
14:26 < jrandom> oOo: unfortunately, we lost most of the details pages</p>
14:27 < jrandom> but you're right, we need some filler there</p>
14:27 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Ok, too bad but can live without them ^^</p>
14:27 < jrandom> or to remove the links</p>
14:27 < jrandom> that also reminds me that aum is now working on a DHT, and it seems Nightblade isn't anymore</p>
14:27 < jrandom> (so the distributed data store 'dev' should be updated)</p>
14:29 < jrandom> ok, anway, the 0.4 stuff is coming along - i smacked around a 100 router sim the other day with a few different bandwidth loads, and it held up pretty well</p>
14:29 < jrandom> also fixed a nasty bug in kaffe's jthread scheduler, but there is still some funkiness on fbsd there (but not on linux)</p>
14:30 < jrandom> i dont know how things are coming with the installer..</p>
14:30 < jrandom> but i do recall hypercubus working on it today, so i'm sure we'll find out more when more is ready to be found out</p>
14:31 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Hehe</p>
14:31 < jrandom> does anyone have any questions / concerns / suggestions wrt the 0.4 rev?</p>
14:31 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; "When ?" J/K ;)</p>
14:32 < jrandom> we really don't have much more to add to the code before its ready for 0.4</p>
14:32 < jrandom> (but its not like 0.4 is the end game, we've got a truckload more to do after it)</p>
14:32 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; To Infinity and Beyond !</p>
14:32 < jrandom> exactly ;)</p>
14:33 < jrandom> ok, I guess thats all I've got to bring up, so 4) ???</p>
14:33 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to discuss?</p>
14:33 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; i2pcvs.i2p  revival ?</p>
14:34 < jrandom> yeah, i should probably start that up again</p>
14:34 < jrandom> probably will once we bundle the new router console as primary, with the i2ptunnel.cfg</p>
14:35 < deer> &lt;oOo&gt; Ok, thanks</p>
14:36 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else...</p>
14:36  * jrandom winds up</p>
14:36  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
