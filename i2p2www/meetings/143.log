13:09 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
13:09  * jrandom waves</p>
13:09 <@jrandom> weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-August/000842.html</p>
13:10 <@jrandom> (which i'm sure you've all read studiously)</p>
13:10 <@postman> hi</p>
13:10 <+cervantes> hmm changate perl scripts...will give them a go...</p>
13:10 <+cervantes> hi</p>
13:10 <@jrandom> 1) peer test status</p>
13:11 <@jrandom> not too much to add on this beyond what i posted in the notes - anyone have any questions/comments/concerns with it?</p>
13:11 <@jrandom> i'm not sure whether to verify the remote reachability of everyone who connects to us, but i'm toying with that idea</p>
13:11 <@jrandom> (we do that now with tcp)</p>
13:13 <@jrandom> well, perhaps we can try it without that on a 0.6.0.3 before moving to 0.6.1.  ve zhall zee</p>
13:13 <@jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) irc2p</p>
13:13 <@jrandom> y'all are here, so you know whats up :)</p>
13:13 <@jrandom> nice work postman & smeghead</p>
13:16 <@jrandom> ok, smeghead & postman have been putting out plenty of info on that thaang, so if there's nothing else y'all want to bring up on that, we can swing over to 3) feedspace</p>
13:16 <@jrandom> frosk seems to have stepped out, and i don't really have anything to add beyond whats in the notes (and on his blog)</p>
13:17 <@postman> :)</p>
13:17  * Complication is reading frosk's blog</p>
13:18 <@jrandom> ok, perhaps frosk'll fill us in with a post there when there's more info to share</p>
13:19 <@jrandom> movin' on briefly to 4) meta</p>
13:19 <@jrandom> what are y'all's thoughts on 8p GMT meetings?  too early, too late, just right?</p>
13:21  * jrandom holds back the crowds</p>
13:21 <+Complication> I'd like to say something useful, but cannot seem to find my world clock...</p>
13:21 <@jrandom> google://what+time+is+it</p>
13:22 <+Complication> :)</p>
13:22 <@jrandom> ok, movin' on to 5) ???</p>
13:22 <@jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to bring up?</p>
13:23 <+susi23> well</p>
13:23 <+susi23> not officially ;)</p>
13:24 <+Complication> It's been an unusually stable time.</p>
13:24 <+Complication> Aside from occasional "message invalid" (or was it "packet invalid"), I can't find errors to report. :o</p>
13:24 <@postman> my errors are already reported :)</p>
13:24 <@jrandom> coo', though thats unfortunately a symptom of undetected errors Complication, since there's still some stuff not going as it Should</p>
13:25 <@jrandom> but, progress, ever onwards</p>
13:25 <@jrandom> perhaps we're seeing a lot of restricted routes out there due to the udp situation</p>
13:25 <+susi23> we started a new idlerpg on #idle and you are all invited to join :)</p>
13:25 <@jrandom> (and perhaps there's a bunch of other things...)</p>
13:25 <@jrandom> w00t susi23 </p>
13:26 <+susi23> :P</p>
13:30 <@jrandom> ok, anyone else have something to bring up for the meeting?</p>
13:32 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothin' else</p>
13:32  * jrandom winds up</p>
13:32  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
