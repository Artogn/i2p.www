15:15 < jrandom> 0) hi
15:15  * jrandom waves
15:15 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-December/001239.html
15:15 < jrandom> (*before* the meeting this week - who woulda thunk it?)
15:16 < jrandom> not that it matters, since y'all wait until the meeting starts to read it anyway ;)
15:16 < jrandom> so, movin' on in to 1) Net status and load testing
15:16 <@cervantes> hey!
15:17 < jrandom> thanks for doing your part cervantes ;)
15:17 <@cervantes> read what?
15:17 -!- DreamTheaterFan [anonymous@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]
15:17 < jrandom> I don't have much to add beyond whats in the mail, anyone have any questions or comments on 1)?
15:19 < spaetz> is load testing performed on *the* i2p net or do you have a private net for this?
15:19 < jrandom> I'm doing it on the live net
15:19 < spaetz> just curious
15:19 < spaetz> k
15:20 < jrandom> its being done carefully though, backing off hard from peers under load, and it of course honors tunnel rejections
15:20 <@cervantes> recent irc2p instability was unrelated to the tests
15:21 <@cervantes> (in case you were wondering)
15:21 < jrandom> hows the new setup handling things cervantes?  
15:21 <@cervantes> been rock solid so far
15:22 < jrandom> cool
15:22 <@cervantes> just took some tedium to track down the source of the gremlins
15:24 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have any questions/omments, or shall we jump on over to 2) I2PSnark?
15:25 < jrandom> consider us jumped
15:26 < jrandom> ok, basically I2PSnark should work again... there were a few attributes not yet in the BT spec but used by azureus and rufus, causing incompatibility, but we're now compatible with the situations I was able to see
15:26 < jrandom> i2psnark now works with all of the torrents i've tested, but if anyone runs into trouble, let me know
15:27 < jrandom> part of the drive for me to fix that up was in relation to some SAM bugs, since I2PSnark doesn't use SAM
15:28 < jrandom> not much more to add on that front... unless anyone has any questions, lets move on over to 3) Syndie
15:29 -!- Xunk [Xunk@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]
15:30 < jrandom> ok, I don't have much to add beyond the email on that front either
15:31 -!- Xunk [Xunk@irc2p] has joined #i2p
15:31 < jrandom> if there aren't any questions re: Syndie, lets continue on and open the floor with 4) ???
15:31 -!- DreamTheaterFan [anonymous@irc2p] has joined #i2p
15:32  * jrandom remembers that clunk wasn't in the agenda, among other things.  anyone have anything they want to bring up?
15:32 <@cervantes> man speeding though
15:32 <@cervantes> *through
15:33 -!- bar [bar@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]
15:33 < jrandom> aye, no need to talk just to see words on the meeting logs :)
15:33 -!- bar [bar@irc2p] has joined #i2p
15:33 -!- mode/#i2p [+v bar] by chanserv
15:33 -!- mule [mule@irc2p] has joined #i2p
15:35 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else...
