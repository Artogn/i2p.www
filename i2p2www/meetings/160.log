15:15 < jrandom> 2) I2PSnark</p>
15:15 < jrandom> 3) Syndie</p>
15:15 < jrandom> 4) ???</p>
15:15 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:15  * jrandom waves</p>
15:15 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-December/001239.html</p>
15:15 < jrandom> (*before* the meeting this week - who woulda thunk it?)</p>
15:16 < jrandom> not that it matters, since y'all wait until the meeting starts to read it anyway ;)</p>
15:16 < jrandom> so, movin' on in to 1) Net status and load testing</p>
15:16 <@cervantes> hey!</p>
15:17 < jrandom> thanks for doing your part cervantes ;)</p>
15:17 <@cervantes> read what?</p>
15:17 -!- DreamTheaterFan [anonymous@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]</p>
15:17 < jrandom> I don't have much to add beyond whats in the mail, anyone have any questions or comments on 1)?</p>
15:19 < spaetz> is load testing performed on *the* i2p net or do you have a private net for this?</p>
15:19 < jrandom> I'm doing it on the live net</p>
15:19 < spaetz> just curious</p>
15:19 < spaetz> k</p>
15:20 < jrandom> its being done carefully though, backing off hard from peers under load, and it of course honors tunnel rejections</p>
15:20 <@cervantes> recent irc2p instability was unrelated to the tests</p>
15:21 <@cervantes> (in case you were wondering)</p>
15:21 < jrandom> hows the new setup handling things cervantes?  </p>
15:21 <@cervantes> been rock solid so far</p>
15:22 < jrandom> cool</p>
15:22 <@cervantes> just took some tedium to track down the source of the gremlins</p>
15:24 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have any questions/omments, or shall we jump on over to 2) I2PSnark?</p>
15:25 < jrandom> consider us jumped</p>
15:26 < jrandom> ok, basically I2PSnark should work again... there were a few attributes not yet in the BT spec but used by azureus and rufus, causing incompatibility, but we're now compatible with the situations I was able to see</p>
15:26 < jrandom> i2psnark now works with all of the torrents i've tested, but if anyone runs into trouble, let me know</p>
15:27 < jrandom> part of the drive for me to fix that up was in relation to some SAM bugs, since I2PSnark doesn't use SAM</p>
15:28 < jrandom> not much more to add on that front... unless anyone has any questions, lets move on over to 3) Syndie</p>
15:29 -!- Xunk [Xunk@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]</p>
15:30 < jrandom> ok, I don't have much to add beyond the email on that front either</p>
15:31 -!- Xunk [Xunk@irc2p] has joined #i2p</p>
15:31 < jrandom> if there aren't any questions re: Syndie, lets continue on and open the floor with 4) ???</p>
15:31 -!- DreamTheaterFan [anonymous@irc2p] has joined #i2p</p>
15:32  * jrandom remembers that clunk wasn't in the agenda, among other things.  anyone have anything they want to bring up?</p>
15:32 <@cervantes> man speeding though</p>
15:32 <@cervantes> *through</p>
