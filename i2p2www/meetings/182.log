16:05 < jrandom> 1) Net status
16:05 < jrandom> 2) 0.6.1.21
16:05 < jrandom> 3) ???
16:05 < jrandom> 0) hi
16:05  * jrandom waves
16:05 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-June/001293.html
16:06 < jrandom> while y'all dig through that, lets jump on over to 1) Net status
16:07 < jrandom> the network's behavior isn't that great at the moment - it works pretty well for some people, but for others, it doesn't work at all
16:07 < modulus> .20 works pretty well for me, where .19 didn't work at all, but i guess that's just anecdote.
16:08 < jrandom> you say anecdote, i say data point :)
16:08 < jrandom> there'll be a new release tomorrow though which should improve things a bit
16:09 < jrandom> oh, i suppose thats 2)... anyone have anything else on 1) net status they'd like to discuss first?
16:10 < jrandom> if not, lets jump to 2) 0.6.1.21
16:11 < jrandom> 0.6.1.20-7 is cvs head, and will become 0.6.1.21 sometime tomorrow
16:12 < jrandom> it should improve the ability for fast peers to handle more tunnels, which in turn should improve everyone's success rates
16:13  * jrandom currently gets ~30-60% success rates (excluding expirations) - hopefully the expirations will be cut further
16:14 < jrandom> ok, I don't have much more to add on that front- the changes are listed in the history.txt, so keep an eye out tomorrow for the release
16:14 < jrandom> (also, remember that it may take up to 12 hours to push the release out, so its probably best to either build -7 or wait until the actual announcement on the mailing list/website)
16:15 < jrandom> ok, lets shimmy on over to 3) ???
16:15 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to bring up?
16:15 < user-land> are there recommendations for routers that can take the load from i2p ?
16:15 < NickyB> yes
16:15 < NickyB> about the ircproxy
16:15 < user-land> and what holds up i2p 1.0 ? :-)
16:16 < jrandom> user-land: to the first question, no (other than "patience")
16:16 < jrandom> to the second question, see the first question
16:16 < NickyB> first, sorry for my poor english. My ircProxy is set to be reachable on my lan, like all others proxy (eeproxy too) but my 6668 is reachable on the Net....
16:17 < jrandom> NickyB: when you say on your lan, what is the *interface* it is bound to (on http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/index.jsp)
16:18 < jrandom> NickyB: if the interface is "0.0.0.0", yes, it will accept connections from anywhere.  if its "127.0.0.1" it will only accept connections from the localhost.  if its "10.0.0.123" or "192.168.1.42", then it will accept connections from your LAN
16:19 < NickyB> err, for my console, i did a change in client.config
16:19 < NickyB> clientApp.0.args=7657 192.168.0.1 ./webapps/
16:19 < NickyB> 192.168.0.1  is the adresse gived to all my proxy 
16:19 < NickyB> Reachable by:
16:20 < NickyB> LAN Hosts
16:20 < NickyB> 192.168.0.1
16:20 < NickyB> and my 4444 is not reachable on the net, but my 6668 yes
16:20 < jrandom> NickyB: you need to stop and start that particular i2ptunnel proxy for the changes to take effect
16:21 < jrandom> though, perhaps we can continue debugging after the meeting (as this is all logged ;)
16:21 < NickyB> will try, thank you
16:21 < jrandom> np, thanks for your patience
16:21 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?
16:21 < fedo> why the .21 will not be a *mandatory* release ? i ask that because we have a lot of .12 .13 etc. routeurs. This may not help for the network health ...
16:23 < jrandom> the old routers don't hurt much, and there arent too many of them (something like 2-300 stay within 1 release of current)
16:23 < user-land> my hardware router crashed under i2p load. that is why i asked for hardware recommendations.
16:24 < jrandom> ah, sorry, misundertood your question user-land.  i've been able to get by with cheap linksys and belkins, though i dont know what switches they have at the current colo
16:24 < user-land> thanks.
16:25 < jrandom> fedo: the real key of ...21 is that 1) fast routers upgrade (and they're the most likely to anyway) and 2) that users be on ...19 or higher
16:26 < fedo> ok Jr
16:26 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?
16:28 < user-land> thanks for your efforts :-)
16:28  * ashter2 seconds user-land
16:28 < user-land> and http://www.savetheinternet.com/
16:29 < jrandom> (bah, never trust politics to defend us.  use technology)
16:29 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothin' else...
16:30  * jrandom winds up
16:30  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
