14:59 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
14:59 < jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
14:59 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
15:00 <+void> jrandom: fyi, bookmark management is not working as of 8e18877de3908c52daae6d8a85fc8c671cdfb5d5</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
15:00 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:00  * jrandom waves</p>
15:00 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-February/001336.html</p>
15:01 < jrandom> void: drag and drop onto the bookmarks currently doesn't refresh the display (the bookmarks are added but not shown) - working on that in the other dwindow atm :)</p>
15:01 <+void> ah :)</p>
15:01 < jrandom> if thats not what you're referring to, please file a bug report</p>
15:01 <+void> (well, i already filed a bug report for that</p>
15:01 <+void> )</p>
15:02 < jrandom> w3wt</p>
15:02 < jrandom> ok, lets jump into 1) Net status</p>
15:02 < jrandom> i don't really have much to add beyond whats in the status notes</p>
15:04 < jrandom> anyone have anything they'd like to add re: 1) Net status?</p>
15:06 < jrandom> if not, lets shimmy on over to 2) Syndie dev status</p>
15:06 < bar> jrandom: yeap, Traditional Chinese language support fixed the "china.i2p" issue and Simplified Chinese fixed your "peace" post</p>
15:06 < jrandom> ah great bar</p>
15:06 < bar> (oops, sry!)</p>
15:08 < jrandom> in theory we could bundle actual fonts and distribute them with syndie (which might make sense in some situations, like the preinstalled CDs/images that anonymous recently discussed)</p>
15:10 < jrandom>  (specifically, in the bug report @ urn:syndie:channel:d7:channel44:Ffn4RhCunO6gwMfAYfOoPY7FGwPNDy65dS4DyuyorME=9:messageIdi1171666081846ee )</p>
15:10 < jrandom> anyway, regarding syndie dev status, lots going on there</p>
15:10 < jrandom> i expect we'll have a new release out later this week with the latest goodies</p>
15:12 < jrandom> as always, keep those bug reports and feature requests flowin, and we'll get 'em addressed as soon as possible</p>
15:12 < jrandom> anyone have anything to add re: 2) Syndie dev status?</p>
15:15 < jrandom> ok if not, lets slide to 3) ???</p>
15:15 < jrandom> anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?</p>
15:16 <+Complication> not anything I'd recall in a hurry :)</p>
15:18 <+Complication> (not yet, at least)</p>
15:18 < jrandom> heh in that case...</p>
15:18  * jrandom winds up</p>
15:18  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
