12:01 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
12:01 < jrandom> 1) 0.6.0.3 status</p>
12:01 < jrandom> 2) IRC status</p>
12:01 < jrandom> 3) susibt</p>
12:01 < jrandom> 4) Syndie</p>
12:01 < jrandom> 5) ???</p>
12:01 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
12:01  * jrandom waves</p>
12:01 < lucky> hi</p>
12:02 < jrandom> weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-August/000857.html</p>
12:02 < lucky> hihihihi</p>
12:02 < jrandom> hi lucky </p>
12:02 < jrandom> ok, jumping into 1) 0.6.0.3 status</p>
12:02 < jrandom> i think the biggest things worth mentioning wrt 0.6.0.3 are in the status notes, but beyond that, anyone have anything to bring up?</p>
12:04 < gott> What's the deal with 'Unknown' ?</p>
12:04 < jrandom> i'm not sure whether the ssu cwin improvements will come in 0.6.0.4 or will wait until 0.6.1 when we have better peer / configuration</p>
12:04 < jrandom> gott: there are two paragraphs in the email related to that - do you have any specific questions beyond those?</p>
12:05 < jrandom> or is there some point i could clarify?</p>
12:05 < gott> No, I just haven't read the bloody email.</p>
12:05 < jrandom> heh</p>
12:05 < jrandom> well, scroll up five lines and read the bloody email ;)</p>
12:06 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have any questions on 0.6.0.3?</p>
12:07 < jrandom> if not, moving on to 2) IRC status</p>
12:07 < modulus> sorry guys, but need to leave. later all.</p>
12:08 < jrandom> beyond whats in the mail, postman/cervantes/arcturus: y'all have anything you want to bring up?</p>
12:08 < jrandom> l8r modulus</p>
12:08 <+arcturus> on 1)?</p>
12:08 <+arcturus> oh sorry</p>
12:08 < gott> Hmm.</p>
12:08 <+arcturus> 2) it is now</p>
12:09 < gott> How much upstream bandwidth does IRC over i2p usually take at the moment ?</p>
12:09 <+arcturus> netsplits are history</p>
12:09 <+arcturus> gott: i coudln't say that without compromising my router's anonymity</p>
12:09 < gott> No, no, no.</p>
12:10 < jrandom> not sure, my router with squid.i2p/dev.i2p/cvs.i2p/www.cvs/syndiemedia.i2p plus my irc and eepproxy uses on average 10-20KBps</p>
12:10 < gott> Does it require a commercial line ?</p>
12:10 < jrandom> nice1 arcturus</p>
12:10 < gott> jrandom: I mean to say, to host.</p>
12:10 < jrandom> gott: to operate a server or a client?</p>
12:10 < jrandom> ah</p>
12:10 <+arcturus> gott: i couldn't say that without compromising my router's anonymity</p>
12:10 < gott> server.</p>
12:10  * jrandom knows not.  probably less when you have just one ircd</p>
12:10 < gott> So are you running a modified unrealircd ?</p>
12:11 < jrandom> say, add a factor of 1.3 to the client usage for a single server</p>
12:11 <+arcturus> i'd like to also add that inter-server lag is steady and very very low</p>
12:11 < gott> I assume you are, since there doesn't seem to be a VERSION command</p>
12:11 <+arcturus> i disabled version</p>
12:12 < gott> Are your modifications open-source ?</p>
12:12 <+arcturus> maybe we're running unreal, maybe we aren't :)</p>
12:12 < gott> You should put them up so others can start their own private networks.</p>
12:12 <+arcturus> i can't tell you without compromising security</p>
12:12 < gott> security through obscurity, sweet.</p>
12:12 < jrandom> word arcturus.  i'm seeing something like 0-2s lag on average (at the moment, less than irssi's lag detector)</p>
12:12 <+arcturus> no, it's only one layer of security</p>
12:13 <+arcturus> and it only serves as a deterrent, no substitute for technical security measures</p>
12:15 < jrandom> arcturus: how goes with vanguard?</p>
12:15 <+arcturus> i haven't coded on it lately, other projects have been occupying me, but there's a constant, steady pressure i feel to get around to finishing it :)</p>
12:16 < jrandom> heh coo'</p>
12:16 <+arcturus> vanguard will be most effective against bots, the hashcash measure is a separate deal</p>
12:16 <+arcturus> i'm concerned about hashcash now though</p>
12:17 <+arcturus> with the latest attacks against sha-1</p>
12:17 <+arcturus> it won't be long before there are tools available to the masses</p>
12:17 <+arcturus> unfortunately the standard hashcash implementation is based entirely on sha-1</p>
12:17 < susi23_> Unable to find a javac compiler; // com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath. // Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK</p>
12:18 <@cervantes> ah made it</p>
12:18 < susi23_> any ideas about this? JAVA_HOME points definitely to the right dir, javac is in PATH and callable</p>
12:18 <+arcturus> susi23_: we're in a meeting atm :)</p>
12:18 < jrandom> susi23_: OOM?</p>
12:18 < susi23_> meeting? though its 8pm?</p>
12:18 < jrandom> (precompile your jsps rather than letting jetty/tomcat do it, its faster ;)</p>
12:19 < jrandom> yeah we moved it susi23_ :)</p>
12:19 < susi23_> didn't know, sorry</p>
12:19 < jrandom> hehe np, glad you made it for the meeting, your agenda item is up next ;)</p>
12:20  * susi23_ sits down and listens</p>
12:20 <+arcturus> so while i don't expect immediate problems with hashcash, i think it's feasible sha-1 could be seriously compromised soon</p>
12:21 < jrandom> arcturus: hashcash with md5 would probably be fine</p>
12:21 < jrandom> its just a PoW</p>
12:21 <+arcturus> if anyone knows of any hashcash implementations based on sha256 or higher please met me know</p>
12:21 <+arcturus> well PoW is pointless if there's little P in it :)</p>
12:21 < jrandom> the size of the hash only matters when your hashcash reaches the size of the hash</p>
12:23 < jrandom> (but, yeah, running against a truncated sha256 or 512 or whirlpool or whatever would be neat)</p>
12:23 <+arcturus> i guess we could go ahead with the current implementation, perhaps we can design it so that we can swap it out easily later when we need to</p>
12:24 < jrandom> (DTSTTCPW)</p>
12:25 <+arcturus> because we will eventually need to drop sha-1, i'm sure of it :) and if we can't be reasonably certain a token was generated properly there's no reason to even be using hashcash</p>
12:25 < jrandom> (its only for a PoW to get a nym on irc, not to get access to fort knox ;)</p>
12:26 <@cervantes> there's some talk on the hashcash mailing list about implementing sha256</p>
12:26 <+arcturus> it's not for a nym, it's for entry to the server</p>
12:26 <+arcturus> cervantes: cool i'll check that</p>
12:27 <+arcturus> jrandom: and it's not just PoW, the hashcash is what gives us a method to uniquely identify clients on the network, akin to being able to identify by IP, so that we can ban with precision</p>
12:28 < jrandom> certainly those are renewed over time though, right?</p>
12:28 < jrandom> e.g. a new PoW cert every 6 months (or 6h, or whatever)</p>
12:28 <+arcturus> if a user doen't have to do any work to get their ID, that nullifies our ability to ban them</p>
12:29 <+arcturus> i don't know of any reason to expire them automatically, only expire them manually if they violate terms of service</p>
12:29 <+arcturus> no need to make people do unnecessary work for new IDs</p>
12:29 < jrandom> eh, its just a passive PoW, they can run one cycle every 6 hours to regenerate a new one</p>
12:29 < jrandom> but perhaps DTSTTCPW</p>
12:30 <+arcturus> any hashcash genereated must be used within 24 hours or it is invalid</p>
12:32 <@cervantes> just to reiterate the new server irc.freshcoffee.i2p needs to be added into your i2ptunnel console</p>
12:32 < jrandom> coo'.  ok, anything else for 2) irc2p?</p>
12:33 <@cervantes> (http://forum.i2p/viewtopic.php?t=911</p>
12:33 <@cervantes> )</p>
12:33 <@cervantes> &lt;-- done</p>
12:34 <+arcturus> i don't have anything else to bore you all with :)</p>
12:34 < jrandom> hehe</p>
12:34 < jrandom> ok, 3) susibt</p>
12:34 < ardvark> um, when I add the new server to my tunnel, do I have to restart i2p?</p>
12:34 < jrandom> susi23_: p1ng</p>
12:35 <@cervantes> ardvark: just the tunnel</p>
12:35 <@cervantes> (ircproxy tunnel)</p>
12:35 < ardvark> oh ok, I just added and saved, so that is not enuff then</p>
12:36 < jrandom> right, unfortunately you need to stop and start that proxy</p>
12:36 < susi23_> well</p>
12:36 < ardvark> but i'll miss the meeting then ;)</p>
12:37 < susi23_> susibt is a webapp (like susimail) to drop into your routers VM</p>
12:37 < susi23_> it acts as a web frontend for i2p-bt</p>
12:38 < susi23_> so you can manage your seeds, up- and download files etc.</p>
12:38 < jrandom> w00t</p>
12:39 < susi23_> the prob is, you need to start a btdownloadheadless.py for each seed... so you get lot of python processes to your many java threads :)</p>
12:39 <+arcturus> that will be addressed in ducktorrent *cough*</p>
12:39 < jrandom> heh</p>
12:39  * jrandom holds breath</p>
12:40 < susi23_> it even supports restart of seeds after router restart</p>
12:40 <@cervantes> nice</p>
12:40 < jrandom> wikked</p>
12:40 < susi23_> future plans are automatic build of torrents and ui improvement</p>
12:41 < susi23_> if you want to try it out, I recommend a separate jetty instance</p>
12:41 < susi23_> so you don't have to fiddle with your router :)</p>
12:41 < susi23_> download and installation instructions on http://susi.i2p</p>
12:42 < susi23_> thats all *ping back to jr*</p>
12:42 < jrandom> w3wt, gracias susi</p>
12:42 < jrandom> ok, anyone have any questions & comments on that, or shall we jump on over to 4) syndie?</p>
12:44 < jrandom> ok regarding syndi, i've posted a bunch to the list about it over the last day or two, and there'll be lots more activity</p>
12:45 < jrandom> the main demo site for syndie is http://syndiemedia.i2p / http://66.111.51.110:8000/, but of course people are encouraged to download it and install it locally</p>
12:45 < jrandom> i dont have too much to add at the moment on that frnt. unless anyone has any questions?</p>
12:46 < gott> Why is it called syndie ?</p>
12:46 < gott> is it a reference to 'syndicate' ?</p>
12:47 < jrandom> yeah, its a generic syndication frontend (+ security, authentication, and anonymity awareness)</p>
12:48 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 4), lets jump on over to 5) ???</p>
12:48 < jrandom> anyone have anythin i2p related to bring up for the meeting?</p>
12:51 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else</p>
12:51  * jrandom winds up</p>
12:52  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
