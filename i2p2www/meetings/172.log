<div class="irclog">
15:09 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 2) ???</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> 0) hi</p>
15:09  * jrandom waves</p>
15:09 <@jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-March/001270.html</p>
15:10 <@jrandom> while y'all read that massive missive, lets jump into 1) Net status</p>
15:10 <@jrandom> the net seems to still work (woot)</p>
15:12 < bar> got me a new udp connection high score yesterday, 244</p>
15:12 <@jrandom> I don't have much more to add on that front - anyone have any comments/questions/concerns?</p>
15:12 <@jrandom> ah nice</p>
15:12 <@jrandom> yeah, I'm hitting peak values too, currently 338 SSU connections</p>
15:14  * jrandom has also done some substantial i2psnark transfers, though not always at great rates</p>
15:15 <@jrandom> I've seen some interesting cyclical variations on stats.i2p regarding tunnel selection though, but that'll be seeing some changes as .0.6.1.13 rolls out</p>
15:17 <@jrandom> I've also been doing some low(er) bandwidth testing and optimization, and thats really whats currently holding up ...13.  I think we'll have some good stuff down the pipe, but we'll see how it goes</p>
15:18 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 1) Net status, lets move on over to the floor - 2) ???</p>
15:18 <@jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up?</p>
15:18 <+Complication> I have only record uptimes to report, and to add that build -6 is very conservative on accepting participating tunnels</p>
15:19 <+Complication> (but I mentioned that already earlier)</p>
15:19 <@jrandom> nice - its doing well with the lower peer counts still, too, right?</p>
15:19 <+Complication> Peer counts have recently risen a bit, actually</p>
15:20 <@jrandom> ah 'k</p>
15:20 <+Complication> They are now more like 50...100</p>
15:20 <+Complication> (generally more towards 50 than 100)</p>
15:20 <@jrandom> oh, so still fairly low compared to before</p>
15:20 <+Complication> The around-30 values seem to have been as low as it gets</p>
15:21 <+Complication> But generally, it's doing fine</p>
15:21 <@jrandom> great</p>
15:26  * jrandom would like to take this moment for a brief shout-out to some recent contributors supporting I2P - special thanks go out to bar, $anon, postman, and the rest of the folks up at http://www.i2p.net/halloffame!</p>
15:27 <@jrandom> contributions of code and content of course are critical, but financial support helps keep me out of the normal workforce and crunching on I2P fulltime, plus our varied infrastructure costs</p>
15:28 < bar> me blushes, but thanks :)</p>
15:28 <@cervantes> w00t</p>
15:29 <+Complication> nice :)</p>
15:31 < ripple> jrandom: pastebin.i2p...mission accomplished....</p>
15:32 <@jrandom> ripple: thanks - it looks like it behaves as desired - on OOM, it dies a fast and horrible death, which the service wrapper detects and restarts the router</p>
15:32 <@jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
15:34 < tmp> Yes, let's pray for the recovery of Betty.</p>
15:34  * tethra prays</p>
15:34 <@jrandom> your prayers have been answered - she's back :)</p>
15:34 < tmp> Faith based I2P.</p>
15:35 < tmp> Ok. ;)</p>
15:35 < tethra> awesome</p>
15:35 < tethra> XD</p>
15:35 < fc> tmp: is that a transport protocol or what?</p>
15:35 < tethra> anonymous prayer?</p>
15:35 <@jrandom> betty == my laptop</p>
15:35 < tethra> not even god knows who you are!</p>
15:36 <@frosk> how about the new machine that bar so awesomely donated?</p>
15:36 <+susi23> jr: you did not name it susi??? shame on you ;)</p>
15:37 <@jrandom> the new machine is currently being assembled, an x86_64 (x2) box for windows, gentoo, and perhaps fbsd</p>
15:37 <@frosk> cool</p>
15:37 <@jrandom> (once its ready, expect some photos on my blog ;)</p>
15:38 < fc> bsd! bsd! bsd! ;)</p>
15:38 <@jrandom> susi23: the new one will need a new name... ;)</p>
15:38 <@cervantes> susan!</p>
15:39 <@jrandom> ;)</p>
15:39 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else for the meeting...</p>
15:39  * jrandom winds up</p>
15:39  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
