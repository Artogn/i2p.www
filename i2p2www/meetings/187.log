15:33 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status
15:33 < jrandom> 3) ???
15:33 < jrandom> 0) hi
15:33  * jrandom waves
15:33 < jrandom> weekly status notes up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-October/001316.html
15:33  * tethra waves back!
15:34 < jrandom> lets jump on in to 1) net status
15:34 < jrandom> no news on this front afaik... things seem stable
15:34 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up on it?
15:35 <+tethra> nothing here
15:36 < jrandom> ok lets jump on to 2) Syndie dev status then
15:37 < jrandom> as mentioned in the notes, i've been exploring some wysiwyg editor components, but it seems a big pain in the ass (no suprise), and no great solution exists afaik
15:38 < jrandom> so, right now my thoughts are to go with a basic editor with helpers like you see on forums like forum.i2p.net.  not wysiwyg, but helpful
15:39 <+tethra> makes sense. might wysiwyg be a progression later on, then?
15:39 < jrandom> of course, if someone tracks down a good small oss wysiwyg editor, i'd love to hear about it (though i've reviewed a dozen options)
15:39 < jrandom> aye, thats a great way for later enhancement
15:40 <+tethra> less of a jump between geek and non geek that way :)
15:40 <+tethra> (have you looked at Nvu?)
15:41 < jrandom> aye, huge, but promising
15:41 <+tethra> which others had you looked at?
15:42 <+tethra> out of interest
15:42 < jrandom> everything i could google into.  no list at hand
15:42 <+tethra> ah, right
15:44 < koff> Would it be useful to have a split view with the html at the bottom and a realtime updating rendering of the page at the top?
15:45 <+tethra> or maybe left/right (being able to choose would be lovely
15:45 <+tethra> )
15:45 < jrandom> aye, thats a good idea (not entirely realtime, but semi-realtime)
15:46 <+tethra> yeah, refresh button etc
15:46 < jrandom> perhaps on 5s idle or a button press
15:46 < jrandom> right
15:48 < koff> You could maybe even have two cursors, so you almost feel like you're navigating both at the same time?
15:48 <+tethra> that'd be a bit confusing :/
15:48 < koff> maybe :)
15:50 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else on 2) syndie dev status?
15:51 < jrandom> if not, lets move on to 3) ???
15:51 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to bring up for the meeting?
15:54 <+fedo> yeah Jr , can hope to have a "joe 6 pack"'s  guide to use syndie 1.0 ? ie : what we can do with that text mode console ...
15:55 <+fedo> i'll love to help to test syndie but i'm still unable to understand how to use syndie ! :)
15:55 < jrandom> fedo: does http://syndie.i2p.net/manual.html and http://syndie.i2p.net/features.html and http://syndie.i2p.net/usecases.html help?
15:55 < jrandom> is it a question of "what can you do with syndie", or "how can you do $x"?
15:55 <+fedo> hm not really Jr :-/
15:56 <+fedo> really, i try to do it ...
15:56 <+fedo> how i can use syndie ...
15:57 <+fedo> the text mode console is not a problem
15:57 < jrandom> how you can use syndie /to do what/?  or is that the question itself - why would you install and use syndie?
15:57 <+fedo> but what to do when i've installed Syndie is one :-s
15:57 < jrandom> ah
15:58 < jrandom> ok, think of syndie like a customized web browser - you install it so that you can participate in forums.  once you install it, you need to tell it what forums you want to participate in
15:59 < jrandom> the current 0.919b install will out of the box tie in to the syndie archive at http://syndie.i2p.net/archive/ - you can just install it, log in, and sync up
16:00 < jrandom> and once you've synced up, you can read posts to the various forums, post up replies, or post up to your own forum
16:01 <+fedo> Jr : i'm thinking that you could made a breif note to explain how to use Syndie : ie how to sync, how to fecth a post ...
16:02 <+tethra> (or even, an example repository (syndie.i2p.net ?) to sync to)
16:02 <+tethra> oh, didn't read above :/
16:02 <+tethra> nvm
16:03 < jrandom> fedo: good idea, i'll write one up
16:03  * fedo waves
16:05 < jrandom> ok cool, anyone have anything else for the meeting?
16:05 <+fedo> we know that you to enable the use of syndie on freenet : tell us how to do it ... (you know that i'm unable to find by reading the syndie's code :-/ )
16:05 <+fedo> ((help me :))
16:06 < jrandom> http://syndie.i2p.net/manual.html#syndicate_freenetpost
16:06 < jrandom> and http://syndie.i2p.net/manual.html#syndicate_getindex
16:07 <+fedo> many 'neurones' to burn but i'll  try :)
16:07 < burl> fedo: Complication has written a brief and pretty handy startup guide on the forum here: http://forum.i2p/viewtopic.php?p=8860#8860
16:08 < jrandom> ah right, thats a good one burl
16:08 <+fedo> thanks burl : i'll have a look to that note ;)
16:12 < jrandom> word, ok, if there's nothing else for the meeting...
16:12  * jrandom winds up
16:12  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
