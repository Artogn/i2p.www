21:02:08 <duck> Tue Jun  8 21:02:08 UTC 2004</p>
21:02:21 <duck> meeting time</p>
21:02:33 <duck> writeup is at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-June/000268.html</p>
21:02:39 <duck> but I did make a mistake in the numbering</p>
21:02:45 <duck> so the first item 5 will be skipped</p>
21:02:53 <hypercubus> yay!</p>
21:03:03  * duck puts some ice in his beer</p>
21:03:14  * mihi 'd rename first #5 to #4 ;)</p>
21:03:27 <hypercubus> nah, let's just have two item 4's next week ;-)</p>
21:03:37  * duck renames 'hypercubus' to 'mihi'</p>
21:03:48 <hypercubus> yay!</p>
21:03:49 <duck> ok</p>
21:03:53 <duck> * 1) libsam</p>
21:04:02 <duck> is there a Nightblade in the channel?</p>
21:04:39 <duck> (idle     : 0 days 0 hours 0 mins 58 secs)</p>
21:05:03 <hypercubus> ;-)</p>
21:05:53  * duck reclaims the microphone</p>
21:06:15 <duck> Nightblade wrote a SAM lib for C / C++</p>
21:06:23 <duck> it compiles for me.. but that is all I can say :)</p>
21:06:37 <mihi> no test cases? ;)</p>
21:07:06 <duck> if there are any rFfreebsd users Nightblade might be interested in you</p>
21:07:08 <ugha_node> The strstr calls really annoyed me in the code. ;)</p>
21:07:27 <ugha_node> duck: What's a rFfreebsd?</p>
21:07:42 <duck> how I did type freebsd</p>
21:08:00 <mihi> rm -rF freebsd?</p>
21:08:29 <ugha_node> Too bad -F doesn't work with rm.</p>
21:08:30 <duck> ugha_node: its bsd licensed; so fix it</p>
21:08:41 <fvw> sounds sane to me :). Alas I uninstalled my last freebsd box a while back. I </p>
                have accounts on other peoples' boxes though, and am willing to run testcases.</p>
21:08:43 <ugha_node> duck: I might. :)</p>
21:08:50 <duck> (damn BSD hippies)</p>
21:09:09 <duck> oh, nice and short frank</p>
21:09:17 <duck> mo libsam comments?</p>
21:09:49 <duck> fvw: I guess Nightblade will contact you if he has a need</p>
21:09:50  * fvw grumbles at perfectly sane unix behaviour for killing his irc client.</p>
21:10:02 <duck> but since his email was a week old be might have found something</p>
21:10:17 <mihi> fvw: ?</p>
21:10:24 <fvw> yeah, if someone wanted to take me up on my offer I sort of missed that. Feel </p>
                free to send email or something.</p>
21:10:42  * duck hops to #2</p>
21:10:46 <hypercubus> uhm, to where? ;-)</p>
21:10:54 <duck> 2) browse i2p and normal web with one browser</p>
21:10:57 <fvw> fresh install, haven't yet told my zsh not to hup stuff in the bacgrkground. </p>
                </offtopic></p>

21:11:09 <fvw> hypercubus: I'm on the public mailinglist user list I think. fvw.i2p@var.cx</p>
21:12:11 <duck> there was some stuff about adding all TLDs to your brower proxy ignore list</p>
21:12:23 <fvw> does that require discussion? I think it was pretty much handled on the </p>
                mailinglist.</p>
21:12:24 <duck> I think it is a dirty hack</p>
21:12:36 <fvw> yes, that was mentioned. Welcome back.</p>
21:12:47 <duck> fvw: I didnt read the thread :)</p>
21:13:12 <duck> okay, if you dont want to discuss it, move to #3</p>
21:13:19 <duck> * 3) chat channel</p>
21:13:23 <hypercubus> cervantes' script works perfectly on Konqueror 3.2.2, Firefox 0.8, and </p>
                       Opera 7.51, all for Gentoo w/KDE 3.2.2</p>
21:13:39  * mihi places a flag on #4</p>
21:13:55 <duck> #i2p-chat is an alternative channel here for offtopic chat and light support</p>
21:14:08 <duck> I dont know who did regg it</p>
21:14:12 <hypercubus> i did</p>
21:14:17 <duck> so better be careful :)</p>
21:14:22 <fvw> ehm, there is no #4, just two #5's :)</p>
21:14:33 <hypercubus> i'll be lucky if i can remember the password when i need it ;-)</p>
21:14:33 <mihi> [22:27] -ChanServ-      Channel: #i2p-chat</p>
21:14:33 <mihi> [22:27] -ChanServ-      Contact: hypercubus &lt;&lt;ONLINE &gt;&gt;</p>

21:14:33 <mihi> [22:27] -ChanServ-    Alternate: cervantes &lt;&lt;ONLINE &gt;&gt;</p>
21:14:37 <mihi> [22:27] -ChanServ-   Registered: 4 days (0h 2m 41s) ago</p>
21:15:12 <hypercubus> i gave a few trusted peeps op powers for whenver i'm not around and </p>
                       there's trouble</p>
21:15:24 <duck> sounds good</p>
21:15:39 <duck> it might be a bit overkill</p>
21:15:51 <hypercubus> you never know on IRC ;-)</p>
21:15:55 <duck> but after this protogirl did join here I thought it would be good to clean up </p>
                 this chan</p>
21:16:03 <hypercubus> heh</p>
21:16:27 <hypercubus> we'll need it for sure sometime in the next few months anyhow</p>
21:16:34 <duck> jups</p>
21:16:48 <duck> and then the freenode ppl will kick us out </p>
21:16:55 <hypercubus> ;-)</p>
21:17:13 <duck> they dont like anything that isnt written in their kampf</p>
21:17:16 <duck> err</p>
21:17:44  * duck moves to $nextitem and triggers mihi's breakpoint</p>
21:17:47 <hypercubus> i figured tying the new channel in with support would legitimize it for </p>
                       freenode</p>
21:18:47 <duck> hypercubus: you might be surprised</p>
21:19:04 <hypercubus> *cough* i admittedly didn't read all the policies...</p>
21:19:24 <duck> it is russian roullete</p>
21:19:39 <hypercubus> hmm, didn't think it would be quite that dire</p>
21:19:52  * duck is being negative</p>
21:19:54 <hypercubus> well i'll look into what we can do</p>
21:20:09 <fvw> sorry, I must have missed something. Why would freenode kick us off?</p>
21:20:21  * duck looks at the timeout counter for mihi's breakpoint</p>
21:20:32 <duck> fvw: they focus on development channels</p>
21:20:35 <mihi> ?</p>
21:20:53 <mihi> duck: the breakpoint triggers on /^4).*/</p>
21:21:01 <duck> mihi: but there is no #4</p>
21:21:06 <fvw> so? i2p is soo alpha that right now even support is development.</p>
21:21:11 <fvw> (and no, you may not quote me on that)</p>
21:21:36 <duck> fvw: you might not be familiar with the types of discussion that did happen </p>
                 on IIP</p>
21:21:38 <hypercubus> yeah but we have *2* channels for it</p>
21:21:45 <duck> and which will likely happen in #i2p channels</p>
21:22:04 <duck> I am pretty sure that freenode does not appreciate it.</p>
21:22:10 <Nightblade> i'm here now</p>
21:22:49 <hypercubus> we'll donate a margarita machine to them or something</p>
21:22:49 <mihi> duck: what do you refer to? the floods? or #cl? or what?</p>
21:23:08 <fvw> discussions on IIP or discussions on #iip? I've never seen anything apart from </p>
                devel and support on #iip. And discussions on IIP would move to I2P, not </p>
                #i2p@freenode.</p>
21:23:09 <duck> all kinds of non political correct talk</p>
21:23:36 <fvw> there's margarita machines? Ooh, me want.</p>
21:23:54 <duck> oh well</p>
21:24:38 <hypercubus> shall we revisit 2)?</p>
21:24:58 <duck> hypercubus: what do you have to add about the browser proxy?</p>
21:25:18 <hypercubus> oops, number 1... since nightblade just graced us with his presence ;-)</p>
21:25:33 <duck> Nightblade: we took the freedom to 'discuss' libsam</p>
21:25:42 <Nightblade> Ok, i'll say a few lines</p>
21:25:48 <hypercubus> but yeah i had something that wasn't brought up on the list about the </p>
                       browser thing too now that i think about it</p>
21:25:56 <duck> Nightblade: fvw told us that he might be able to help with some freebsd </p>
                 testing</p>
21:26:20 <fvw> I don't have a freebsd machine anymore but I have accounts on freebsd </p>
                machines, give me test cases and I'd be happy to run them.</p>
21:27:02 <Nightblade> I have started working on a C++ dht, which uses Libsam (C).  At this </p>
                       point I have not gotten especially far although I've been working a lot </p>
                       on it.  right now nodes in the dht can "ping" each other through a sam </p>
                       data message</p>
21:27:09 <Nightblade> in the process i found a couple minor bugs in libsam</p>
21:27:18 <Nightblade> which i will post a new version of sometime in the future</p>
21:27:51 <ugha_node> Nightblade: Could you please remove those 'strstr' calls from libsam? :)</p>
21:27:52 <Nightblade> the test case is: try to compile it and report the errors to me</p>
21:28:01 <Nightblade> what is wrong with strstr</p>
21:28:21 <ugha_node> It's not meant to be used instead of strcmp.</p>
21:28:38 <Nightblade> oh yeah, also I am going to port libsam to windows, but that is not in </p>
                       any near future</p>
21:29:07 <Nightblade> is there anything wrong with the way i am using it, besides aesthetics?</p>
21:29:15 <Nightblade> you can send me changes or tell me what you'd rather do</p>
21:29:19 <Nightblade> that just seemed the easiest way</p>
21:29:21 <ugha_node> Nightblade: I didn't notice any.</p>
21:29:32 <fvw> strcmp is more efficient than strstr ofcourse.</p>
21:29:36 <ugha_node> But I just skimmed through it.</p>
21:30:20 <ugha_node> fvw: You can occasionally exploit stuff which uses strstr instead of </p>
                      strcmp, but that's not the case.</p>
21:31:22 <Nightblade> yeah now i see some places where i can change it</p>
21:31:28 <fvw> that too, but I'm assuming you'd have noted that. Well, actually, you'd have </p>
                to use strncmp to prevent those exploits. But that's besides the point.</p>
21:31:31 <Nightblade> i don't remember why i did it that way</p>
21:31:57 <ugha_node> fvw: I agree.</p>
21:32:27 <Nightblade> oh now i remember why</p>
21:32:40 <Nightblade> it is a lazy way of not having to figure the length for strncmp</p>
21:32:49 <duck> heh</p>
21:32:52 <ugha_node> Nightblade: Heheh.</p>
21:33:01 <fvw> use min(strlen(foo), sizeof(*foo))</p>
21:33:04 <hypercubus> shall the spanking commence?</p>
21:33:15 <fvw> I thought the oral sex came first? *ducks*</p>
21:33:32 <fvw> right, next point I think. Hypercube had a comment about proxying?</p>
21:33:38 <hypercubus> heh</p>
21:33:54 <duck> bring it on!</p>
21:34:03 <Nightblade> i will make the changes for the next version - change some of them at </p>
                       least</p>
21:34:25 <hypercubus> ok, well this had been discussed briefly in channel a few weeks back, </p>
                       but i think it bears revisiting</p>
21:34:48 <deer> * Sugadude volunteers to perform the oral sex.</p>
21:34:59 <hypercubus> rather than adding TLD's to your browser's block list, or using the </p>
                       proxy script, there's a third way</p>
21:35:29 <hypercubus> which shouldn't have the same drawbacks as the other two approaches </p>
                       anonymity-wise</p>
21:36:17 <fvw> which I'll tell you for the cheap cheap price of $29.99? Spill it already!</p>
21:36:27 <hypercubus> and that would be to have the eeproxy re-write incoming html pages to </p>
                       embed the page in a frameset... </p>
21:36:58 <hypercubus> the main frame would contain the requested HTTP content, the other </p>
                       frame would serve as a control bar</p>
21:37:13 <hypercubus> and would allow you to turn on/off proxying at will</p>
21:37:40 <hypercubus> and will also alert you, perhaps via colored borders or some other kind </p>
                       of alert, that you're browsing non-anonymously</p>
21:37:54 <fvw> how are you going to prevent an i2p site (with javascript etc) from turning </p>
                off anonimity?</p>
21:37:59  * duck tries to apply jrandom-skill-level-of tolerance</p>
21:37:59 <hypercubus> or that a link in an eepsite page leads to the RealWeb(tm)</p>
21:38:04 <duck> cool! make it!</p>
21:38:16 <fvw> you'll still have to do something fproxy-like, or make something </p>
                non-browser-controlled for switching.</p>
21:38:29 <ugha_node> fvw: Right.</p>
21:39:10 <hypercubus> that's why i'm throwing this out here again, perhaps someone might have</p>
                        some ideas about how to secure this</p>
21:39:31 <hypercubus> but imo this is something that will be sorely needed for most i2p end </p>
                       usrers</p>
21:39:33 <hypercubus> *users</p>
21:40:04 <hypercubus> because the TLD/proxy script/dedicated browser approaches are too much </p>
                       to ask of your general net user</p>
21:40:29 <fvw> In the long run, I think an fproxy workalike is the best idea. But that's </p>
                definately not a priority imho, and I don't actually think browsing sites will </p>
                be the i2p killer app.</p>
21:40:42 <Sonium> What is the netDb anyway?</p>
21:40:59 <duck> Sonium: database of known routers</p>
21:41:10 <hypercubus> fproxy is too cumbersome for most users</p>
21:41:32 <Sonium> doesn't such a database compromise annonymity?</p>
21:41:39 <hypercubus> imo it's part of the reason freenet never caught on in the non-dev </p>
                       community</p>
21:41:41 <fvw> hypercube: not necessarily. proxy autoconfiguragion ("pac") can make it as </p>
                simple as filling in a single value in your browser config. I think we </p>
                shouldn't underestimate the fact that in the foreseeable future, all the i2p </p>
                users will be at least slightly clueful computer-wise. (all evidence on </p>
                freenet-support notwithstanding)</p>
21:42:00 <ugha_node> Sonium: No, 'bad guys' could collect that information manually anyway.</p>
21:42:21 <Sonium> but if NetDb is down i2p is down, right?</p>
21:42:29 <fvw> hypercubus: Not really, I think the fact that it hasn't worked at all since </p>
                early 0.5 is more to blame for that. </offtopic time="once again"></p>

21:42:44 <fvw> Sonium: you can have more than one netdb (anyone can run one)</p>
21:42:58 <hypercubus> we already have pac, and even though it works spectacularly from a tech </p>
                       standpoint, realistically it's not going to protect the anonymity of </p>
                       the avg. jog</p>
21:43:03 <hypercubus> *avg. joe</p>
21:43:22 <ugha_node> fvw: Err.. Every router has its own netDb.</p>
21:43:42 <duck> ok. I am about to pass out. be sure to *baff* the meeting closed after you </p>
                 are done</p>
21:43:52 <ugha_node> I2P has no central dependencies anymore.</p>
21:44:07 <hypercubus> ok, well i just wanted to get this idea formally in the logs ;-)</p>
21:44:30 <fvw> ugha_node: ok, a published netdb then. I don't actually run a node (yet), I'm </p>
                not entirely up with the terminology.</p>
21:44:34 <ugha_node> Hmm. Didn't mihi want to say something?</p>
21:45:05  * fvw feeds duck coffee-flavoured chocolate to keep him up and running a little bit </p>
          longer.</p>
21:45:07 <mihi> no :)</p>
21:45:21 <mihi> is duck a network device? ;)</p>
21:45:25 <ugha_node> mihi: Btw, are you going to take the window size increase bounty?</p>
21:45:28  * fvw feeds duck alcohol-flavoured chocolate to shut him down indefinately.</p>
21:45:30 <hypercubus> in swedish</p>
21:45:52 <mihi> ugha_node: what bounty?</p>
21:46:00 <hypercubus> okay, then on to 5), rant-a-rama? ;-)</p>
21:46:13 <ugha_node> mihi: http://www.i2p.net/node/view/224</p>
21:46:27  * duck eats some of fvw's chocolate</p>
21:47:16 <mihi> ugha_node: definitely no; sorry</p>
21:47:36 <ugha_node> mihi: Uh, okay. :(</p>
21:48:33  * mihi tried to hack up the "old" streaming api some time ago, but that one was too </p>
          buggy...</p>
21:48:53 <mihi> but it would imho be easier to fix that one instead of fixing mine...</p>
21:49:21 <ugha_node> Heh.</p>
21:49:42 <hypercubus> so modest</p>
21:49:46 <mihi> since it already has some (broken) "reordering" support in it</p>
21:50:49 <Sonium> is there a way to ask deer how many people are on the i2p-#i2p channel?</p>
21:51:01 <duck> no</p>
21:51:08 <hypercubus> nope, but i can add that to bogobot</p>
21:51:08 <Sonium> :/</p>
21:51:11 <Nightblade> !list</p>
21:51:13 <deer> &lt;duck&gt; 10 ppl</p>

21:51:24 <Sonium> !list</p>
21:51:32 <Sonium> o_O</p>
21:51:35 <mihi> Sonium ;)</p>
21:51:38 <ugha_node> This is not an fserv channel!</p>
21:51:39 <Sonium> that was a trick!</p>
21:51:40 <ugha_node> :)</p>
21:51:41 <hypercubus> should be !who</p>
21:51:44 <deer> &lt;duck&gt; ant duck identiguy Pseudonym ugha2p bogobot hirvox jrandom Sugadude </p>
                 unknown</p>
21:51:48 <cervantes> oop missed the meeting</p>

21:52:42 <mihi> !ban *!*@*</p>
21:52:50 <hypercubus> i sense a gavel coming down</p>
21:52:51 <duck> sounds like a good time to close it down</p>
21:52:55 <Sonium> btw, you should also implement an !8 command like chanserv has</p>
21:52:59 <fvw> right, now we have that settled, let's clo.. yes. that.</p>
21:53:00  * hypercubus is psychic</p>
21:53:05 <duck> *BAFF*</p>
21:53:11 <Nightblade> !baff</p>
21:53:12 <hypercubus> my hair, my hair</p>
21:53:24  * fvw points at hypercube and laughs. Your hair! Your hair!</p>
