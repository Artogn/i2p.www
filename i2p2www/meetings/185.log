16:01 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
16:01 < jrandom> 1) Net status</p>
16:01 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status</p>
16:01 < jrandom> 3) ???</p>
16:01 < jrandom> 0) hi</p>
16:01  * jrandom waves</p>
16:01 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-October/001314.html</p>
16:02 <+fox> * dm waves</p>
16:02 < jrandom> w3wt, ok, while y'all read that oh-so-fun missive, lets jump on to 1) net status</p>
16:03 < jrandom> the net seems to be maintaining the steady state right now, though with a slight growth trend</p>
16:04 < jrandom> there are some discussions on the big cpu-related issue on the forum, though no big win yet, afaics</p>
16:04 < jrandom> anyone have anything to bring up re: 1) net status?</p>
16:05 < jrandom> (the last full week w/ 0.6.1.26 seems to have gone well [yay])</p>
16:06 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; well, I better say something</p>
16:06 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; is there a consistent metric that is being used to monitor net status</p>
16:06 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; or is it just ad-hoc experiences?</p>
16:07 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; like is there an application out there that tries to connect to random places every day while measuring response times and failures.</p>
16:07 < jrandom> i'm going largely by irc behavior, as well as the stats and activity on the routers i run (stats.i2p is down for a week or two, but it usually is a solid enchmark to run against)</p>
16:08 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; cool, I'll check that site out.</p>
16:08 < jrandom> there are several people running stat monitoring apps - orion.i2p, tino.i2p, eepsites.i2p, as well as stats.i2p</p>
16:09 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; thank you!</p>
16:09 < jrandom> np :)</p>
16:09 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 1), lets jump on over to 2) syndie dev status</p>
16:10 < jrandom> lots going on, as mentioned in the status notes (and you can finally see a non-hideous-looking website at syndie.i2p.net :)</p>
16:11 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; down at the moment?</p>
16:11 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; scratch that</p>
16:11 <+fox> * dm shuts up</p>
16:11 < jrandom> :)</p>
16:12 < marlowe> jrandom, the diagram on the front page is very helpful</p>
16:12 < marlowe> i know understand the concept behind syndie</p>
16:12 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; it's pretty as well</p>
16:13 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; but how do you access syndie without download/installing it? I remember you could do this before?</p>
16:13 < jrandom> great, glad its clear marlowe - it can be a confusing concept in just text :)</p>
16:13 < jrandom> dm: the old syndie (syndiemedia.i2p.net/) was web based, but this new one is, well, brand new, completely redesigned</p>
16:14 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; it's not web-based?</p>
16:14 < jrandom> (and thanks to cervantes for turning my ugly ms-paint-style image into the slick pic you see there :)</p>
16:14 < jrandom> no, its not web based - current release is actually text only, but work continues on a gui</p>
16:14 < jrandom> http://syndie.i2p.net/roadmap.html</p>
16:14 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; text-only! wow. ok. downloading.</p>
16:14 < jrandom> w3wt</p>
16:15 < jrandom> one important thing you need to know to effectively use it is the location of a syndie archive that you can push posts to and pull posts from</p>
16:15 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; wow.. this is hardcore stuff. (Next Command:) hehhehe</p>
16:15 < jrandom> there's currently one at http://syndie.i2p.net/archive - you can sync up with that via "menu syndicate" "getindex --archive http://syndie.i2p.net/archive" and "fetch" :)</p>
16:16 < jrandom> its a fairly simple system, though with very specific design features</p>
16:16 < jrandom> (and incredibly robust - it can run on anything :)</p>
16:17 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; there's something cool about really complex apps running with a text frontend</p>
16:17 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; anyway...</p>
16:17 <+fox> * dm shuts up again</p>
16:19  * jrandom hopes to bring us up to 1.0 sometime this month, so beta testing would be great</p>
16:20 < jrandom> (kick the tires, tell me whats broken, etc)</p>
16:20 < jrandom> 1.0 won't include the gui, of course, thats 2.0</p>
16:20 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; of course</p>
16:21 < jrandom> ok, anyone have any comments/questions/suggestions/toenails on 2) Syndie dev status?</p>
16:22 < jrandom> oh, one thing i wanted to bring up - as i posted in my syndie blog, we need a logo!  so, see urn:syndie:channel:d7:channel44:bF2lursCrXhSECJAEILhtXYqQ6o-TwjlEUNJLA5Nu8o=9:messageIdi1160962964161ee :)</p>
16:23 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; there's a good place to get free or semi-free very high quality logos</p>
16:24 < jrandom> flickr?  :)</p>
16:24 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; http://www.worth1000.com/ &lt;--- photoshop geeks around try to outdo each other for a little fame and/or money</p>
16:24 < jrandom> ah cool</p>
16:25 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; example of a previous 'contest' http://www.worth1000.com/cache/contest/contestcache.asp?contest_id=12170&start=1&end=10&display=photoshop</p>
16:25 <+fox> * dm shuts up again</p>
16:26 < jrandom> wikked, thanks dm</p>
16:27 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing on 2, lets jump to 3) ???</p>
16:28 < jrandom> anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
16:28 < bar> perhaps we should save that for the 1.99b version and have a little contest/bounty thing going to plug syndie 2.0?</p>
16:28 < jrandom> ah, thats a good idea, since 1.* is going to be text anyway</p>
16:30 < bar> think about it, i'm sure we can dig up some funding</p>
16:30 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; how's funding going anyway? </p>
16:31 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; are you still doing this full-time jr?</p>
16:31 < jrandom> aye, still getting by, thanks to some insanely generous contributors (thanks!)</p>
16:31 < jrandom> http://www.i2p.net/halloffame</p>
16:32 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; ah yes.. the shoestring budget. I remember now</p>
16:32 < jrandom> hehe</p>
16:34 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up?</p>
16:34 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; just dropped you a c-bill. Make sure it's only used for alcohol or other frivolous uses.</p>
16:34 <+fox> &lt;dm&gt; oh and keep my real name secret!</p>
16:34 < jrandom> w00t!  thanks dm</p>
16:36 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else...</p>
16:36  * jrandom winds up</p>
16:36  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
