15:03 < jrandom> weekly status notes up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-January/001329.html
15:05 < jrandom> as y'all dig through that, lets jump on in to 1) Net status
15:05 < jrandom> not much change at the moment on this front
15:06 < jrandom> interesting to note the updated domains chart on http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/serv_domain.cgi listing a good spread of hosts even after pruning 2000 old entries
15:07 < jrandom> zzz: what period is that chart based off?
15:07 <+zzz> 1 month
15:07 < jrandom> wow cool
15:09 < jrandom> of course, the NICs aren't always up to date, but it gives a good view of things from a high level.  nice work zzz, thanks
15:10 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up for 1) net status?
15:12 < jrandom> if not, lets hop on over to 2) i2psnark updates
15:12 < jrandom> zzz, wanna give us the low down?
15:13 <+zzz> we have improvements in fairness when > 4 leechers, a fix for the longstanding restart-torrent bug, don't start a tunnel if autostart unchecked, and adding some more links on the webpage.
15:13 <+zzz> added a stop-all button which usually doesn't work if there is traffic, it seems
15:13 <+zzz> looking for testers and reports as usual, thanks
15:14 < jrandom> kickass, thanks zzz
15:14 < jrandom> when you feel its right, we can package 'er up and ship a new 0.6.1.27 w/ that bundled
15:15 <+zzz> ok maybe a week or 2
15:16 < jrandom> sounds good
15:17 < jrandom> ok lets jump on over to 3) Syndie progress
15:17 < jrandom> logs going on in this front as mentioned, and we'll hopefully be pushing out a new rev in the next day or two
15:19 < jrandom> there'll be an announcement when thats out, in syndie, on the web pages, on the forum, and in the list
15:19 < jrandom> ok, swinging over to 4) ???
15:20 < jrandom> anyone have anything else they want to bring up for the meeting?
15:23 < jrandom> if not...
15:23  * jrandom winds up
