15:07 < jrandom> 0) hi
15:07  * jrandom waves
15:07 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-January/001328.html
15:09 < jrandom> while y'all continue drooling over the macworld stuff, lets jump on in to 1) net status
15:09 < jrandom> i don't have anything to mention here this week, but felt bad not including the net status in the report, so here it is
15:09 < jrandom> anyone have anything to add regarding the network status?
15:09 <+zzz> I'm testing a couple of i2psnark tweaks, nothing major
15:10 < jrandom> ah cool, regarding the recent bug reports, or other goodies we can look forward to?
15:11 <+zzz> other - mostly better handling of torrents with > 4 peers
15:11 < jrandom> wikked
15:11 <+zzz> also catching a couple of common OOM spots rather than dumping the whole JVM
15:12 < tea> sounds great, atm i2p-bt seems the best choice for "high"-speed torrents
15:12 <+zzz> i.e where it grabs a whole 256KB - 1MB chunk to store a piece
15:13 <+zzz> everybody pick a torrent and pile onto it to help me test :)
15:14 < jrandom> kickass, let us know when we should try things out zzz
15:14 < tea> shall someone redo 'casino royale' ? :)
15:14  * jrandom mentions that this meeting is logged and posted on the web ;)
15:15 <+void> oh, the meeting
15:15 < tea> no volunteers, then
15:16 < jrandom> ok cool, anyone have anything else for 1) Net status?
15:17 < bar> while we're mentioning i2psnark...
15:18 < bar> ...would it be possible to start, stop and restart i2psnark from the console?
15:18 < bar> (rather than restarting the whole router to kill the tunnels)
15:19 <+zzz> don't know - jrandom you have any thoughts?
15:20 < jrandom> bar: when you say stop and start, what does that entail beyond stopping and starting the inividual torrents?
15:21 < bar> killing the i2psnark tunnels that are draining my resources when not torrenting
15:22 < bar> (the tunnels don't die when you remove the .torrents, iirc)
15:22 < jrandom> ah, stopping the actual i2p destination for it.  doable without much trouble, the web interface has access to the SnarkManager
15:23 < jrandom> (an interim workaround could be to set the tunnel lengths to 0 until you need to use them again)
15:23 < jrandom> but you're right, that would be useful
15:23 <+void> you could change the tunnels to have 0 depth, although that would be error prone
15:23 <+zzz> good idea to provide a stop tunnel button on the web page, agreed
15:23  * jrandom !hi5s void
15:24 <+void> ack, i'm lagging *that* much?
15:24 < jrandom> I2PSnarkUtil already has a static .disconnect() too
15:25 < jrandom> (so calling that from the I2PSnarkServlet should be trivial)
15:25 < jrandom> zzz: you wanna hit that, or you want me to toss that in there?
15:27 <+zzz> I don't see a question there so take it
15:27 < jrandom> ok cool, shall do
15:27 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else on 1) Net status?
15:29 < jrandom> if not, lets hop over to 2) I2Phex 0.1.1.38
15:29 < jrandom> Complication: wanna pelt us with the low down?
15:31 < jrandom> afaik, there's a good summary of changes in the CVS and announcement (http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=2005)
15:33 < tea> is there a possibility of permantly changing the tunnel lengths ?
15:34 < jrandom> sure, i recall there's a place where you can set them in the i2phex config file by specifying the custom i2p options (though i don't recall the i2phex config file option to use at the moment)
15:35 < bar> tea: yes, in i2phex.cfg (i2pInboundLength, i2pInboundLengthVariance, i2pOutboundLength, i2pOutboundLengthVariance)
15:36 < tea> i was thinking of the option tab i2p-rufus has
15:37 < tea> could something like that be added ? 
15:38 < jrandom> i think complication said that'd be a good idea, so its probably pretty doable
15:38  * jrandom hasn't done any gui hacking in i2phex (though I'm sure if you sent in a patch, I'd make sure it went in :)
15:38 < jrandom> oh, nm, seems complication said 'e's working on it
15:39 < jrandom> http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=2005#9149
15:39 < tea> as an amateur rufus user i was pleased to see the pop up question 'allow zero hop connections ?', and be able to click no ...
15:42 < jrandom> aye.  ok, anyone have anything else on 2) I2Phex 0.1.1.38?
15:42 < bar> well, while we're at it, i think congratulations to the original Phex team on their 3.0 release are in order, it came out just the other day :)
15:43  * bar waves
15:43 < jrandom> aye, congrats ArneBab et al!
15:45 < tea> maybe they'll wave back one day ...
15:46 < jrandom> ArneBab and GregorK have had some good feedback on i2phex over the years 
15:46 <+void> the day that i2phex reaches version 3.0?
15:46 < jrandom> here's hopin :)
15:47 < bar> we'll be long gone by then, but yeah :)
15:48 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on over to 3) Syndie progress
15:48 < jrandom> lots of progress in the last week, including 1.001a hitting the street
15:50 < jrandom> though most of the discussion on that front is going on within syndie itself
15:50 < jrandom> so, if you're not on it yet, get on it and find out more :)
15:51 < jrandom> anyone have anything they'd like to discuss regarding syndie?
15:53 <+void> well, i just ran sync and it imported one unread message with a bunch of read ones
15:53 <+void> but i guess we'll debug that after the meeting?
15:54 < jrandom> hmm, aye, quite strange (i imported a few new messages recently, and they showed up as unread).  but yeah definitely need to dig some more into that
15:54 < jrandom> ok, lets hop on over to 4) Syndie bug harvesting contest
15:55 <+void> can you register anonymous egold accounts?
15:55 < jrandom> aye, no ID necessary
15:56 <+void> ah, cool
15:56 < jrandom> though, of course, they can freeze fraudulent accounts, and they do track all the transfers, and share the transfer data with Them
15:56 < jrandom> but it is more than sufficient to defend against most adversaries
15:57 <+void> yeah, naturally
15:58  * jrandom has found the bug reports and feature requests invaluable, and while I realize the $50USD doesn't come close to compensate the actual time involved, its hopefully a small token of thanks
15:58 < jrandom> I'm hoping we'll continue this contest every month
15:58 <+void> hehe
15:59 <+void> heheat least it's fun time
15:59 <+void> arg
16:00 < jrandom> does anyone have any questions regarding the contest, or suggestions, or frisbees?
16:01 <+tethra> contest?
16:01 <+tethra> (i am late)
16:01  * tethra reads up
16:01 <+tethra> cool :o
16:02 < jrandom> so get yer bug reports flowin' :)
16:03 < jrandom> ok, lets swing on over to 5) ???
16:03 <+void> they already are :)
16:03 <+tethra> yessir! ;)
16:03 < jrandom> aye, thanks!  (yes, I'm counting everything from jan1 to jan31 :)
16:03 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?
16:04 <+fox> <nony> does it run on java6?
16:04 < tea> sure
16:04 <+tethra> come to that, does it compile with gcj?
16:04 < jrandom> nony: i run it on java6 here, yes
16:04 < jrandom> tethra: aye, and runs ;)
16:04 <+tethra> excellent
16:04 <+tethra> ;)
16:04 <+fox> <nony> sweet
16:07 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?
16:09 < jrandom> if not...
16:09  * jrandom winds up
16:09  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
