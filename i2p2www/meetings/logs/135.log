13:13 < jrandom> 0) hi
13:13 < jrandom> 1) 0.5.0.5
13:13 < jrandom> 2) UDP (SSU)
13:13 < jrandom> 3) Q
13:13 < jrandom> 4) ???
13:13 < jrandom> 0) hi
13:13  * jrandom waves
13:13  * smeghead particles
13:13 < jrandom> weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-March/000661.html
13:14 < jrandom> (an hour early *mumblemumble*)
13:14 < jrandom> anyway, jumping in to 1) 0.5.0.5
13:15 < jrandom> as mentioned in the status notes, there'll be a new release later this evening
13:15 < jrandom> everyone who is not yet on 0.5.0.4 should upgrade ASAP, as you'll be unable to talk to 0.5.0.5 users
13:15 < jrandom> all 0.5.0.4 users should upgrade as soon as 0.5.0.5 is out, as well
13:16 <@smeghead> will the update work through the new trusted update facility in the router console?
13:17 < jrandom> yes and no
13:17 < jrandom> of course, 0.5.0.4 has a bug in the NewsFetcher, where it doesn't write to a temp file, but instead resumes /over/ the existing file 
13:18 < jrandom> so, given the way that the NewsFetcher detects updates, it won't see the later "hey, 0.5.0.5!  get it!" info
13:18 < zzz> yes if you want to wait 12 hours? there's no 'update now' button, is there?
13:18 < jrandom> otoh, once 0.5.0.5 is out and the news.xml is updated, 0.5.0.4 users can delete the file and it'll fetch it, detect it, and let you update
13:19 <@smeghead> what's the name of this file?
13:19 <@smeghead> oh ic
13:19 < jrandom> zzz: if news.xml doesn't exist or if it hasn't been modified in 12 hours, a new rev is fetched
13:20 < jrandom> there'll be a new i2pupdate.zip made available, as well as i2pupdate.sud
13:20 < jrandom> (though for later revs, the .zip may not be provided)
13:20 <@smeghead> should news.xml be in the base install dir?
13:20 < jrandom> smeghead: docs/news.xml
13:21 <+Myo9> Would it not good to get updates anonymous by default?
13:21 <+Myo9> s/not/"not be"/
13:22 < jrandom> Myo9: last week bla offered a counterpoint to that - the fact that you're running i2p is not secret, and using your eepproxy to fetch it could let dev.i2p see what destination is used
13:22 <+frosk> anyone can tell you're running a router anyway
13:22 <+ant> <mae^> lalalala
13:22 < jrandom> just as it isn't a good idea to say on irc "hey, i'm restarting my router now", you dont want to associate your nyms with your router's activity
13:23 <+Myo9> Ok.
13:23 <+ant> * mae^ covers his ears
13:23 < jrandom> but, on the other hand, if dev.i2p were truely an anonymous host (aka we didn't know it was dev.i2p.net), we'd need support for it :)
13:23 <+ant> <mae^> dont talle me your goddamn network passwword
13:24 <+ant> <mae^> damnit
13:25 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything for 1) 0.5.0.5?
13:25 <+ant> <mae^> lets all take take a minute to thank jr ight now
13:25 <+ant> <mae^> silently and to yourself...
13:25 <@smeghead> mae^: how about after the meeting
13:25 < jrandom> heh, and to the donations page ;)
13:25 <+ant> <mae^> or to him and private is ifine too
13:26 <+ant> <mae^> or donate!
13:26 < jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) UDP (SSU)
13:26 < jrandom> we've got some thoughts on the new UDP protocol up on the web, and some critical feedback would be great
13:27 <+ant> * cervantes notes the royal "we"
13:27 <@smeghead> what is SSU
13:27 < jrandom> well, i may be the one who types it in, but we've all been discussing the issues ;)
13:28 < jrandom> SSU == Secure Semireliable UDP
13:28 < jrandom> http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/router/doc/udp.html?rev=HEAD
13:28 <+ant> <Eol> ??? got i2p up and running but can't resolve the .i2p sites .... states point browser at 4444 proxy but privoxy + tor already there ... site.i2p:4444 also fails ... ideas (w/o disabling privoxy or tor)
13:28 <@smeghead> Eol: --> #i2p-chat
13:29 < jrandom> Eol: perhaps some people in #i2p-chat can help, we're in the weekly dev meeting right now
13:30 < jrandom> the basic gist of things is that we'll be able to work around most NATs, but unfortunately not all of 'em.  stats show that it'll work for a substantial % though (75-95, depending upon who you ask)
13:31 < jrandom> ok, thats that, really - if anyone has any questions/comments/concerns, feel free to bounce me or the list an email anytime
13:31 <+ant> * Eol apologizes
13:31 <@smeghead> the remaining should rebel against their tyrannical system admins
13:31 < jrandom> np eol
13:32 <@smeghead> (or splurge for a real net connection)
13:32 < jrandom> or get a non-symmetric NAT
13:32 <+frosk> (or wait for restricted routes)
13:32 < jrandom> yeah, or wait for 2.0 :)
13:32 <@smeghead> because really, if you're concerned about freedom of information and anonymity, you shouldn't subject yourself to such NAT restrictions beyond your power anyhow
13:32 < jrandom> smeghead: not everyone has a choice in the matter
13:33 < jrandom> for instance, we had a user here the other day from the UAE, where there is ONE isp, with their own NAT
13:33 <@smeghead> very true, but there are also people who expect us to bend over backwards to support them when they should be getting their power back
13:33 <@smeghead> right
13:34 < jrandom> aye, we'll support what we can, and what we can't, well, we can't, yet
13:34 <@smeghead> the more people bend over for their ISPs, the more ISPs will restrict their users, and the harder our task becomes
13:37 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything for 2) UDP?  if not, moving on to 3) Q
13:37 < jrandom> hmm, looks like aum isn't up yet :)
13:37 < jrandom> but basically, lots of cool stuff up @ http://aum.i2p/q/
13:38 <@smeghead> i think i speak for aum when i say, "zzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZz"
13:39 < jrandom> ok, i dont know if i have anything to add beyond whats in the email, beyond "neat stuff, talk to aum" :)
13:40 < jrandom> ok, moving on at a rapid rate to 4) ???
13:40 < jrandom> anyone else have anything they want to bring up?
13:41 < cervantes> whoa a sub half hour?
13:41 < jrandom> first i get the meeting notes out an hour early, and now this!
13:41 <@smeghead> time for a filibuster
13:41 < jrandom> *cough*
13:41 <+postman> :)
13:41 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else, i can get back to packaging up 0.5.0.5 and y'all can download when its ready :)
13:41 <+postman> ok, just wanted to announce v2mail.i2p
13:42  * cervantes wheels out a ming dynasty china gong
13:42 < jrandom> ooh word postman 
13:42 <+postman> as official portal to the v2mail deleopment
13:42 <+postman> the html layout eats babys
13:42 <+postman> but still i hope you find the docs/whitepapers there interesting
13:43 <+postman> the documentation will be updated over the next week
13:43 <@smeghead> could you say a little about what v2mail is?
13:43 <@smeghead> v2 like version 2, or like the rocket?
13:43 <+postman> smeghead: the new decentralized mailservice for i2p 1.0
13:43 <+postman> smeghead: v2 refers to the version
13:44  * postman does not plan any mailbombs or rockets :)
13:44 <@smeghead> does it have specific dependencies on 1.0, or is that just a target?
13:45 <+postman> there's still a few months work ahead - updates will be announced there
13:45 <+frosk> nice effort, postman
13:45 <+postman> smeghead: no, there're no dependencies on 1.0 - you'll still continue using susimail or your own mua
13:46 <+postman> frosk: thanks 
13:46 <+postman> jrandom: k, /me hands back the microphone
13:47 <+ant> <cervantes> *distant clapping*
13:47 < jrandom> w3rd, it definitely looks cool
13:47 <+postman> cervantes: hey, what about your firefox plugin?
13:47 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have anything to add to the meeting?
13:48 <+ant> <cervantes> postman: eerm still plugin away at it
13:49 <+postman> cervantes: me want play with it :)
13:50 <+ant> <cervantes> just getting through a tedious part of managing user preferences...then all should be ready for a test release
13:50 < jrandom> wikked
13:50 <+postman> c00l :)
13:52 <+ant> <cervantes> on an aside...I seem to have persuaded a few mozilla developers to look into modifying the codebase so I can easily add URI filtering into the plugin (ie I will be able to guarantee no connections to non-i2p addresses are being made)
13:52 < jrandom> oh, nice!
13:52 <+ant> <cervantes> but that won't be in firefox for a couple of releases
13:53 < jrandom> great, please keep us updated
13:53 <+ant> <cervantes> will do
13:54 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else...
13:54  * jrandom winds up
13:54  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
