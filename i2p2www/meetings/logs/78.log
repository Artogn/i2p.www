Considering we did not have a very official meeting do to Jrand0m not
feeling very well, here are my logs of the meeting from slightly
before it started to sometime after it ended.  I have edited out the
kick offs and start screens from iip restarting at least twice during
that period.  If someone else has better logs feel free to replace
these. (baffled)

<human> baffled: we're experimenting a psychic communication towards jrand0m, to ask him to be here for the meeting
<human> baffled: just focus your mind on him, and help us
> Don't we have to hold hands or something like that?
<human> baffled: if it helps you focusing your mind... well, yes
> Cool, gimme your hand I'm commensing to focus!
<UL >
<li> human gives his hand to baffled 
</UL>
human has changed the topic on channel #i2p to I2P meeting: hold the hand of your neighbour, focus your mind on jrand0m, and ask him to come here

<human> wilde: i agree, we could informally talk about the recent history of I2P

<wilde> Hello I2P

<jar> hi
<kaji> ah, i made it

<kaji> hi

<jrand0m> perhaps I can help out with agenda 2) status
<wilde> 2. Status I2P
<jrand0m> the router, as is, is nonfunctional
<wilde> so how are we post-testnet?
> can we cote on that?
<jrand0m> post testnet, yes, but I introduced two bugs in the process
> vote.
<jrand0m> vote on whether its nonfunctional?
> Right.
<UL >
<li> jrand0m wonders if we vote hard enough it'll be functional again
</UL>
<kaji> its dead for me
> oh, nevermind.
> well, we held hands and you appeared.
<jrand0m> hey, worth a shot ;)
<UL >
<li> jrand0m starts a bug-excorcism seance
</UL>
> does that make them bogobugs?
<UL >
<li> DrWoo<a href="iip-wiki?action=edit&id=DrWoo" class=wikipageedit>?</a> sprinkles dried blood on the floor
<li> jrand0m senses that this chant will cause the bugs to dissapear in the next day or two, with an email going out to i2p@ once its ready
</UL>
> oh wooooow!
<kaji> i switched to j2sdk1.4.2_03 to get ant to work on XP, i wonder how much of and effect it has on the router not working
<wilde> so there's a short i2p vacation
<jrand0m> none, I use that build on xp
<jrand0m> the bug is programmer error, probably a trivial one too
<jrand0m> (but quite fatal)
<jrand0m> right wilde
<jrand0m> but after that, I've been making a bunch of progress on the docs for 0.2.5 and 0.3
<jrand0m> so I don't think they'll be a full two weeks out
<jrand0m> but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
<wilde> nice, any application improvments anyone?
<jrand0m> one idea - on the testnet, we focused a lot on irc and echo, more than eepsites
<UL >
<li> wilde notes in the black book who hasn't done todays homework, a cool I2P application
</UL>
> Do you think they suffered for that? I certainly do.
<jrand0m> having lots of clients (aka destinations) on a single router increases the load, and we may want to think about trimming down our test scope, perhaps
<jrand0m> there's also a discussion wrt perhaps revisiting the keysize of the crypto to reduce the load (for another day after we have more metrics, etc) 
Signoff: Robert (Ping timeout)
> What do you consider a lot of clients on one router?
<jrand0m> I dont know, I would like once 0.2.4.x is out and usable that we can use both IRC and eepsites
<jrand0m> that depends on the computer
<wilde> so what's best for now? eepsites or irc?
<UL >
<li> jrand0m wants both, and we will have both functional in the mid and long run
</UL>
<jrand0m> anyway, we can see as 0.2.4.x comes out.  perhaps both will be fine again.
<wilde> yeah but what's most useful for debugging? continous connections or sporadic ones?
<jrand0m> both ;)
<wilde> lighweight irc, or eep graphics?
<jrand0m> i2p needs to support long term streaming connections and short term bursty ones
<kaji> what about heavy long downloads?
<jrand0m> right, long term streaming connections
<jrand0m> (though I do think filesharing over i2p would best be served with i2psnark via messages, ala udp)
<wilde> the question really is: you suggested narrowing the test scope, was that to IRC or EEP?
<wilde> (or something else)
<jrand0m> two or three clients will be fine, I just know that running 4+ services may be a bit of an overload for the time being (depending on people's computer)
lucky (~lucky@anon.iip) has joined channel #i2p
<wilde> ok, that's probably wise
<jrand0m> anyone have any dev status for client apps?
<wilde> so the focus should be on services that can us some statistics, like the irc scripts
<jrand0m> that is definitely key.
Newsbyte (~fredisdea@anon.iip) has joined channel #i2p
<jrand0m> woah
<jrand0m> hi Newsbyte
<Newsbyte> ah, jran
<UL >
<li> wilde looks at the clock and at Newsbyte, late arrival, that will cost you an apple
</UL>
<Newsbyte> huh?
<Newsbyte> I never come here
<jrand0m> also, the echo server and client app is great at gathering stats, and doesn't have any irc-specific dependencies. 
<wilde> nothing
<Newsbyte> besides, what's an I2P meeting without nop? ;-)
<DrWoo<a href="iip-wiki?action=edit&id=DrWoo" class=wikipageedit>?</a>> wilde: heh somehow I dont think hes here for the meeting :)
<human> would an eepsite monitoring tool be useful?
<Newsbyte> no nop, no meeting
<UL >
<li> Newsbyte can summarise
</UL>
<wilde> jrand0m: is there something else you'd like to have statistics in the network?
<jrand0m> human> certainly - perhaps some way to do periodic pings of eepsites, maybe keeping track of changes even?
<human> jrand0m: keeping track of what changes?
<jrand0m> I think with the irc scripts giving us long term disconnect / reliability stats, plus the echo app giving us latency, the only thing left is really throughput
<jrand0m> content on the page changing 
<Newsbyte> yes, and use more then one server
<wilde> a kb/s meter, I2P Pirate Radio someone?
<jrand0m> hmm?  right, when the net is up we usually have between 4-10 servers
<human> jrand0m: it's doable but... how would you use the content change information?
<kaji> i ran a shoutcast stream for a while
<jrand0m> human> that particular aspect wouldn't help me, but would let users use the test (which would tell them whats changed, as well as get them to run the test more [generate more traffic])
<jrand0m> nice kaji
<jrand0m> yeah, aum's streams were up periodically as well
<human> jrand0m: oh, ok, now i understand
<mihi> jrand0m: a chargen service? ;)
<madman2003> bye everyone, good luck with i2p
