01:00 <@mids> Tue Aug 13 23:00:00 UTC 2002
01:00 <@mids> Meeting nr 8!
01:00 <@mids> everybody ready?
01:00 < Neo> yes
01:00 < nop> welcome
01:00 <@mids> thanks
01:01 <@mids> as a sidenote, I feel that my connection is unreliable.. I can die every second
01:01 <@mids> logs are available on http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~mids/iip/
01:01 <@mids> Agenda for today:
01:01 <@mids> 1) Welcome
01:01 <@mids> 2) RC2
01:01 <@mids> 3) Mac OS 9
01:01 <@mids> 4) Website preview
01:01 <@mids> A) Questions?
01:01 <@mids> if you have anything to ask or add.. do so
01:02 <@mids> otherwise I suggest we go to item nr2
01:02 <@mids> .
01:02 <@mids> great
01:02 <@mids> 2) RC2
01:03 <@mids> it should be out months ago :)
01:03 <@mids> but it isnt due to various reasons
01:03 <@mids> the biggest one is the summer/vacation period
01:03 <@mids> as far as I know we are waiting on the relay checker that has to be modified for RC2
01:04 <@mids> last month UserX has squished some more bugs
01:04 <@mids> but nothing serious
01:04 <@mids> once codeshark is back in business.. there is hope
01:05 <@mids> waiting for nop to add optional info
01:05 <@mids> so just have patience
01:05 <@mids> we are doing our best.. working with the resources available
01:05 <@mids> .
01:06 <@mids> according to nop there is an issue with the PRNG
01:06 < nop> for the inner key
01:06 <@mids> Pseudo Random Number Generator
01:06 < nop> technology
01:06 < nop> for rc2
01:06 < nop> it has an initialization problem
01:06 < nop> that is being worked on
01:07 < nop> but it is slow
01:07 < nop> and userx is moving at this time, so it makes it double slow
01:07 < nop> .
01:07 <@mids> .
01:07 <@mids> so keep up the hope  and lets move to the next item
01:07 <@mids> which is... 3) Mac OS 9
01:07 < nop> ok
01:07 < nop> crunch has given me info on that
01:08 < nop> someone just donated another 300 dollars
01:08 < nop> to the project
01:08 < nop> which is awesome
01:08 < nop> crunch and bob are working on the gui and bob is fixing up the socket stuff
01:08 < nop> it's more of a time issue as they are working on another project
01:08 <@mids> how much $ are collected for the port now?
01:08 < nop> but
01:09 < nop> physically 1100
01:09 < nop> is all the money that has been collected
01:09 < nop> we would like to get up to 3500 total
01:09 < nop> if possible
01:09 < nop> so anyone wanting to even donate a dollar
01:09 < nop> would help
01:09 <@mids> so... if you want to have the mac os 9 port for IIP done... contact nop
01:09 < nop> to pay for the development time of Cap'n Crunch and his partner bob
01:09 < Robert> Excellent news. Let Neo or I know if you want another request to be put in on the DC front page.
01:09 < nop> plse
01:10 < nop> another request would be great Robert
01:10 <@mids> I suggest we start doing p
01:10 < nop> we've delivered 700 to Crunch
01:10 <@mids> ublic announces every hour on IIP
01:10 < nop> and 300 will be delivered next week 
01:10 <@mids> just like OPN used to do :)
01:10  * Neo thinks we should put in a 30 minute NAG screen on the os9 app until we get over $3500 :)
01:10 < nop> haha
01:10 < nop> I believe it's a bad idea
01:10 < nop> let's just request
01:11 < nop> not nag
01:11 <@mids> kay :/
01:11 <@mids> .
01:11  * Neo thinks maybe a "I use os9 and have not donated" message broadcast from os9 users also. :)
01:12 < Neo> just kidding
01:12 < nop> hehe
01:12 < ellison> there are a few Mac software companies that put funny requests in pop-ups when you first load the program
01:12 <@mids> maybe an article on macworld?
01:12 < ellison> I've found that approach to the the most effective with me personally
01:13 <@mids> .
01:14 <@mids> lets move on.. cause we have some exciting news!
01:14 < nop> .
01:14 <@mids> which is...
01:14 <@mids> the
01:14 <@mids> Website!
01:14 <@mids> 4) Website preview
01:14 <@mids> specially for you a sneak preview
01:14 <@mids> http://www.citystateinc.com/ellison/invisiblenet/index.html
01:15 <@mids> dont forget to click through to the "Invisible IRC Project" in the upper right corner
01:15 <@mids> ellison just released this preview, he is working on the templates now
01:15 <@mids> after that, copy has to be made to fill the blanks
01:16 <@mids> I think we can have the website live pretty soon
01:16 <@mids> .
01:16 < ellison> we're almost there
01:17 <@mids> comments?
01:17  * mids thinks that everybody is still gasping at the site
01:17 < ellison> i think everyone has passed out from joy and hasn't made it back up on their chairs yet
01:17 < nop> haha
01:18 <@mids> next topic? or are we going too fast?
01:19 <@mids> topic nr 5.. requested by Neo
01:19 <@mids> the ! channels with channel mode +a
01:20 <@mids> on this irc server there can 
01:20 <@mids> err
01:20 <@mids> you can create special ! channels
01:20 <@mids> to create them, type /join !!channelname
01:20 <@mids> then you get a channel like: !A4CEQchannelname
01:21 <@mids> this strange prefix is there to prevent channel collisions after netsplits, some obscure test by the ircnet programmers
01:21 <@mids> but, these channels have something special
01:21 <@mids> you can set the +a mode
01:21 <@mids> with /mode !A4CEQchannelname +a
01:21 <@mids> then the channel becomes truely anonymous
01:22 <@mids> everybody his/her nick becomes 'anonymous'
01:22 <@mids> so you dont know who is talking
01:22 <@mids> try it out.. join !anonymous for a demo
01:23 <@mids> so remember.. to create ! channels: /join !!channel
01:24 <@mids> to join an existing channel: /join !channel
01:24 <@mids> then set +a mode (if you are operator) /mode !prefixchannelname +a
01:24 <@mids> this mode cant be unset
01:24 <@mids> .
01:25 <@mids> that was my topic list for today
01:25 <@mids> any questions?
01:26 <@mids> nope?
01:26 < Robert> No sir.
01:27 <@mids> then I'll end my monologue :)
