16:05 < jrandom> 0) hi
16:05 < jrandom> 1) Net status and 0.6.1.28
16:05 < jrandom> 2) Syndie dev status
16:05 < jrandom> 3) ???
16:05 < jrandom> 0) hi
16:05  * jrandom waves
16:05 < jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-March/001341.html
16:05  * jrandom only recently posted that, so i'll give y'all a minute to read that exiting note ;)
16:08 < jrandom> ok, lets jump on into 1) net status and 0.6.1.28
16:09 < jrandom> things are looking pretty good so far with about half of the net upgraded
16:09 < jrandom> an interesting data point is that the net has grown a bit too, added perhaps another 40-50 active ntcp connections to my router and i see around 700 known router idents
16:10 < jrandom> we'll see how that progresses over the next week or so though
16:11 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything to bring up re: net status or 0.6.1.28?
16:13 < jrandom> ok, if not, lets swing on over to 2) syndie dev status
16:13 < jrandom> lots going on in that front, as mentioned in the notes
16:13 < Amiga4000> hi
16:13 < jrandom> heya Amiga4000 
16:13 < Amiga4000> which point now?
16:13 < jrandom> we just hopped over to 2, but if you have something to bring up for 1, hit me ;?
16:14 < Amiga4000> yeah, posted in syndie right now, I assume my pool isn't working as aspected
16:14 < jrandom> pool?
16:14 < Amiga4000> 2 pout tunnels 2 hops, one 70sec and 1300kb, one 250sec and 1000 kb
16:15 < Amiga4000> ( I refer to the msg in zzz forum on syndie about I2Psnark and pooling inside router)
16:15 < jrandom> i assume those times are expiration times, right, and data is total transferred so far
16:15 < Amiga4000> damned, right
16:15 < jrandom> ok, i replied to that post in syndie - what you see is good
16:15 < Amiga4000> *fine*
16:16 < Amiga4000> sry, wqas to fast in read and not understanding
16:16 < jrandom> if all tunnels expired at the same time, there'd be a rush and a good chance of total failures
16:16 < Amiga4000> correct, any chance to see the lifteime of a tunnel?
16:16 < jrandom> 1300KB and 1000KB is pretty good balancing too
16:16 < jrandom> lifetime is always 10 minutes
16:17 < Amiga4000> ok, I track some more data :_)
16:18 < jrandom> w3wt, thanks for asking about it though, its a good question
16:18 < Amiga4000> ok, and net status: 0.1.28 is fine, although upload of i2psnakr data is slow
16:19 < jrandom> hmm, you were describing 10-15KBps though, right?
16:19 < Amiga4000> right, it was 30-40 before the last 2 or 3 changes by zzz
16:20 < jrandom> hmm, lets see how it progresses as the new-release churn reduces
16:20 < Amiga4000> yes, lets wait 1-2 weeks more :-)
16:20 < jrandom> though in my view, 10-15KBps is good enough
16:21 < Amiga4000> :-)
16:21 < jrandom> (i was actually using the 10-20 range as my target for reasonable usage, rather than 1-5KBps)
16:21 < jrandom> of course, more is better, but a solid 10-15 is great news
16:21 < Amiga4000> I just know it has done the 2-4x of that
16:21 < _bob> Hmm, i2p is using 120% CPU. ;)
16:22 < Amiga4000> and I still can grab data from "internet" via the outproxy< in 20-40 kb rate
16:22 < jadeSerpent> _bob: hope your heatsink/fan is working
16:22 < jrandom> you're referring to kilobytes per second, right Amiga4000?
16:22 < Amiga4000> right
16:23 < jrandom> cool
16:23 < Amiga4000> and even syndie.i2p is in the 40 range
16:23 < jrandom> bob: or you've got a dual or quad proc pc ;)
16:24 < _bob> Didn't know top reported values over 100%.
16:24 < jrandom> i2p is just magic
16:24 < jadeSerpent> i guess it's over the top
16:25 < _bob> Wish I did. Can only route around 150KB/s in each direction as it is now.
16:25  * jadeSerpent dodges rotten fruit
16:27 < jadeSerpent> i have a core 2 duo and i sometimes see various processes using >100%
16:29 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for 1? 
16:30 < jrandom> if not, really moving on to 2 ;)
16:30 < jrandom> not much more to add to that here beyond whats in the mail and the forum
16:30 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up re: 2) syndie dev status?
16:30 < jadeSerpent> i can't wait to try the new editor widget
16:30 < jadeSerpent> the current one is driving me nuts
16:30 < jrandom> heh
16:31 < jadeSerpent> how were you able to pull in native editors on the various platforms?
16:31 < Eric> Just a quick question...why does Susimail take so long to check mail or load? Other .i2p pages load quickly.
16:32 < jadeSerpent> Eric: pop3 is a very verbose protocol, moreseo than http (more packets exchanged per operation)
16:32 < Eric> Ah, alright.
16:33 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: import org.eclipse.swt.widget.Text instead of ...swt.custom.StyledText ;)
16:33 < _bob> Eric = Protocol?
16:33 < jrandom> Eric: aye, the app runs locally but talks a full pop3 subset to the pop3 server
16:34 < jadeSerpent> jrandom: ah so swt does interface to com frameworks
16:34 < Eric> Why not use webmail over HTTP as opposed to a local client fetching and sending via POP/SMTP?
16:34 < jadeSerpent> nm i'll just read the code
16:35 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: well, its a native /text/ widget, not the com html editor widget
16:35 < jadeSerpent> Eric: ask postman that question, and preferably in #i2p-chat ;)
16:35 < Eric> Okay.
16:35 < jadeSerpent> jrandom: oh
16:35  * jadeSerpent was thinking gedit/console/riched32
16:36 < jadeSerpent> s/console/kate/
16:36 < jrandom> jadeSerpent: the com html editor widget is easy enough to integrate too, but itd require a lot of issues
16:36 < jadeSerpent> yeah best do your own parsing for security
16:36 < jrandom> (eg auditing it for security, especially when quoting content)
16:39 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 2), lets jump to 3) ???
16:39 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up for the meeting?
16:40 < jadeSerpent> how's the situation with registerfly
16:40 < jadeSerpent> is i2p.net saved? ;)
16:41 < jrandom> eh not yet sorted, hope to get it dealt with soon
16:41 < jrandom> but y'all have 66.111.51.110 memorized anyway, right?  ;)
16:41 < _bob> i2p.net will soon serve you ads and ads. ;)
16:42 < jadeSerpent> yes, it's the same number i use for the combination on my briefcase
16:42 < jadeSerpent> _bob: that's one of my fears :(
16:43 < jadeSerpent> or redirect to SiteFinder
16:43 < jadeSerpent> what a mess registerfly created heh
16:43 < jrandom> it'll get sorted in the next day or two
16:44 < Eric> Heh, now I remember where I've seen that IP. It's the outproxy IP address.
16:44 < snoopy> jr: check this page, re i2p.net: http://www.dyndns.com/news/releases/registerfly_safe_harbor.html
16:44 < jrandom> aye eric :)
16:46 < jrandom> snoopy: most of the registrars out there are offering discounts to scoop up ex-registerfly users (though luckily we're technically an enom registrant)
16:46  * jrandom just needs to get onto a secure term (tried to earlier today, but the place was closed)
16:47 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?
16:49 < jrandom> if not...
16:49  * jrandom winds up
16:50  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
