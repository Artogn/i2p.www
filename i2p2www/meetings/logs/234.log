20:00:56  <Meeh> Hi
20:01:11  <psi> ?
20:01:13  <psi> hi
20:01:38  <zzz> Is either psi or Meeh willing to serve? Are there any other volunteers or nominations?
20:01:50  <psi> I am willing to serve if desired
20:02:24  <eche|on> available here but not for that job, sorry
20:02:27  <psi> I can also obtain orion's stickers
20:03:23  <zzz> Meeh are you willing to serve or would you rather throw your support to psi?
20:04:49  <zzz> anybody else have any comments?
20:04:59  <Meeh> I can do both, what I mean is I can both serve, and I will ofc. support psi if he's doing it
20:05:45  <psi> pr "team" then?
20:06:12  <Meeh> why not, I can't go to the US so I need anyone there anyway
20:06:21  <psi> works
20:06:27  <zzz> My guess is that psi might have more time than Meeh for this?
20:06:57  <psi> yeah i have buttloads of free time right now and probably for a while
20:07:24  <Meeh> but no problems covering EU/Asia/Africa
20:07:34  <Meeh> Yes in some points I think too
20:07:44  <zzz> Meeh has never had buttloads of time since I've known him
20:08:00  <Meeh> however, I think I can contribute a lot wrt tweeting, speak at conferences, and some outreaching
20:08:17  <zzz> how about psi as head and Meeh as assistant?
20:08:26  <psi> i dont do public speaking so i can outsource that to Meeh
20:08:36  <psi> sounds good
20:08:44  <Meeh> sounds good to me too
20:08:47  <Meeh> I can do the public
20:08:58  <zzz> any objections or other comments?
20:09:44  <zzz> ok great
20:10:28  <zzz> I'll get psi the twitter password. Please get the stickers from orion.
20:10:44  <psi> got it
20:11:19  <zzz> Also please generate and distribute a GPG key for press@, and get welterde to fix up the mailing list accordingly
20:11:27  <zzz> speaking of welt...
20:11:33  <eche|on> ....
20:11:36  <zzz> 2. Replace mtn.i2p2.i2p in default i2ptunnel.config (zzz) (Down since June 12 - possible replacements mtn.killyourtv.i2p or mtn.i2p-projekt.i2p)
20:11:52  * psi nominates kytv's
20:12:05  <zzz> eche|on, kytv_ would either of you care to volunteer?
20:12:15  <zzz> we can't put both in one tunnel as that confuses mtn
20:12:56  <zzz> any others that have been up and running for a while?
20:13:01  <eche|on> you can enter mine, I try to keep it up running as always
20:14:24  <zzz> ok, echelon it is I guess
20:14:37  <eche|on> kytv does a lot of jobs already
20:15:07  <zzz> both of them seem very reliable, so doesn't matter much
20:15:27  <Meeh> mtn.meeh.i2p hs ben running for a year now
20:15:29  <zzz> it's not any more work, maybe just a tiny bit more traffic, probably not even noticeable
20:16:25  <eche|on> can we create 3 tunnels and enable only one?
20:17:55  <zzz> nice meeh, good to know
20:17:55  <zzz> anything else on 2) ?
20:17:55  <zzz> any other topics for the meeting?
20:18:19  <psi> do we have a backup irc?
20:18:39  <psi> it seems that if some/all of postman's stuff goes down we're screwed
20:19:17  <psi> mail+irc is postman so what is the backup meetup in the event postman's stuff is non functional
20:19:29  <zzz> sure we could make 3 tunnels but seems like just added clutter to me
20:19:37  <psi> i have been wondering this for a while now...
20:20:28  <eche|on> ok, right, within 6 weeks release time we can change it fast enough, also really interested people can get in here. Also I can push the key to $trusted person
20:21:54  <zzz> we have 3 IRC servers
20:21:54  <zzz> there is no backup for postman himself...
20:21:54  * zzz warms up his short baffer for the short meeting
20:21:54  * zzz ***bafs the meeting closed
