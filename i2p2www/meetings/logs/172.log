15:09 <@jrandom> 1) Net status
15:09 <@jrandom> 2) ???
15:09 <@jrandom> 0) hi
15:09  * jrandom waves
15:09 <@jrandom> weekly status notes posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2006-March/001270.html
15:10 <@jrandom> while y'all read that massive missive, lets jump into 1) Net status
15:10 <@jrandom> the net seems to still work (woot)
15:12 < bar> got me a new udp connection high score yesterday, 244
15:12 <@jrandom> I don't have much more to add on that front - anyone have any comments/questions/concerns?
15:12 <@jrandom> ah nice
15:12 <@jrandom> yeah, I'm hitting peak values too, currently 338 SSU connections
15:14  * jrandom has also done some substantial i2psnark transfers, though not always at great rates
15:15 <@jrandom> I've seen some interesting cyclical variations on stats.i2p regarding tunnel selection though, but that'll be seeing some changes as .0.6.1.13 rolls out
15:17 <@jrandom> I've also been doing some low(er) bandwidth testing and optimization, and thats really whats currently holding up ...13.  I think we'll have some good stuff down the pipe, but we'll see how it goes
15:18 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on 1) Net status, lets move on over to the floor - 2) ???
15:18 <@jrandom> anyone have anything they want to bring up?
15:18 <+Complication> I have only record uptimes to report, and to add that build -6 is very conservative on accepting participating tunnels
15:19 <+Complication> (but I mentioned that already earlier)
15:19 <@jrandom> nice - its doing well with the lower peer counts still, too, right?
15:19 <+Complication> Peer counts have recently risen a bit, actually
15:20 <@jrandom> ah 'k
15:20 <+Complication> They are now more like 50...100
15:20 <+Complication> (generally more towards 50 than 100)
15:20 <@jrandom> oh, so still fairly low compared to before
15:20 <+Complication> The around-30 values seem to have been as low as it gets
15:21 <+Complication> But generally, it's doing fine
15:21 <@jrandom> great
15:26  * jrandom would like to take this moment for a brief shout-out to some recent contributors supporting I2P - special thanks go out to bar, $anon, postman, and the rest of the folks up at http://www.i2p.net/halloffame!
15:27 <@jrandom> contributions of code and content of course are critical, but financial support helps keep me out of the normal workforce and crunching on I2P fulltime, plus our varied infrastructure costs
15:28 < bar> me blushes, but thanks :)
15:28 <@cervantes> w00t
15:29 <+Complication> nice :)
15:31 < ripple> jrandom: pastebin.i2p...mission accomplished....
15:32 <@jrandom> ripple: thanks - it looks like it behaves as desired - on OOM, it dies a fast and horrible death, which the service wrapper detects and restarts the router
15:32 <@jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?
15:34 < tmp> Yes, let's pray for the recovery of Betty.
15:34  * tethra prays
15:34 <@jrandom> your prayers have been answered - she's back :)
15:34 < tmp> Faith based I2P.
15:35 < tmp> Ok. ;)
15:35 < tethra> awesome
15:35 < tethra> XD
15:35 < fc> tmp: is that a transport protocol or what?
15:35 < tethra> anonymous prayer?
15:35 <@jrandom> betty == my laptop
15:35 < tethra> not even god knows who you are!
15:36 <@frosk> how about the new machine that bar so awesomely donated?
15:36 <+susi23> jr: you did not name it susi??? shame on you ;)
15:37 <@jrandom> the new machine is currently being assembled, an x86_64 (x2) box for windows, gentoo, and perhaps fbsd
15:37 <@frosk> cool
15:37 <@jrandom> (once its ready, expect some photos on my blog ;)
15:38 < fc> bsd! bsd! bsd! ;)
15:38 <@jrandom> susi23: the new one will need a new name... ;)
15:38 <@cervantes> susan!
15:39 <@jrandom> ;)
15:39 <@jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else for the meeting...
15:39  * jrandom winds up
15:39  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
