13:08 < jrandom> 0) hi
13:08 < jrandom> 1) 0.4.2 and 0.4.2.1
13:08 < jrandom> 2) mail.i2p
13:08 < jrandom> 3) i2p-bt
13:08 < jrandom> 4) eepsites
13:08 < jrandom> 5) ???
13:09 < jrandom> 0) hi
13:09 < jrandom> sorry to interrupt dm's agenda
13:09 < jrandom> status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-November/000492.html
13:09 < jrandom> [hi]
13:10 <+postman> ((hi))
13:10 <+postman> :)
13:10 < jrandom> so, as y'all read through that overwhelmingly interesting email, we might as well get the meeting underway
13:10 < jrandom> 1) 0.4.2 and 0.4.2.1
13:11 < jrandom> 0.4.2 is out, as you know, and the results are mixed, but when its not failing bad, it seems to be doing much better ;)
13:12 < jrandom> there will be a release with a whole slew of bugfixes soon - i've been holding off to try to get as many things improved as possible
13:12 < jrandom> as things stand now though, it looks like the 0.4.2.1 release will not yet get the i2p-bt port into tip top shape quite yet
13:12 <+postman> jrandom: what do the bugfixes address - all errors in the new streaminglib or other stuff as well?
13:13 < jrandom> a fast busy loop in the streaming lib that came up from a poorly tested scenario, some SAM issues, IP address detection problems, among other things
13:14 < jrandom> dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/i2p/history.txt?rev=HEAD has the full list
13:14 <+postman> k
13:14 <+postman> thx
13:15 < jrandom> oh, one thing to note about 0.4.2.1 is that it, like 0.4.2, will need to modify your wrapper.config again, so please pay attention to the update instructions when they're out :)
13:15 < jrandom> does anyone have any questions/comments/concerns about 0.4.2?
13:15 < jrandom> (/0.4.2.1)
13:16 < clayboy> been working great here, have been tracking cvs too, always smooth
13:16 < jrandom> wikked
13:17 < bla> It's table (0.4.2): up for days already
13:17 < bla> s/table/stable/
13:17 < jrandom> ah nice, yeah, the bugs havent been hitting everyone
13:17 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else on that, lets jump on to 2) mail.i2p
13:18 < jrandom> i hear postman has some things to discuss
13:18 <+postman> hello
13:18 < jrandom> hi postman, you're up :)
13:18 <+postman> weeks ago i conducted a poll regarding IMAP
13:19 <+postman> since a few weeks passed now i decided to close the polls and to count the vote
13:19 <+postman> result is: not needed - won't be done. period
13:19 <+postman> after talking to susi - she was quite fine wioth pop3 on her webmail interface
13:19 < clayboy> reason wins! :)
13:19 < jrandom> w3wt
13:20 <+postman> so let's just stick to the pop3 end bury any silly imap ideas
13:20 <+postman> :)
13:20  * jrandom gets the shovel
13:20 <+postman> 2.) we're close to 100 registered users
13:21 < clayboy> wow
13:21 <+postman> not all of them public of course, but it still sounds like a quite reasonable number regarding the size of the network 
13:21 <+Ragnarok> so... how about that LDAP address book? :)
13:21 < jrandom> nice
13:21 <+postman> 3. a feature to upload/share you public pgp key is active since weekend
13:21 <+postman> please use it 
13:21 <+postman> www.postman.i2p/user/acc.html
13:22 < clayboy> i'm not taking any credit for that idea :>
13:22 <+postman> the public keys can easily be downloaded with the help of the addressbook
13:22 <+postman> or direct as www.postman.i2p/public/accountname.pub
13:22 < jrandom> ooh cool
13:22 <+postman> the system works quite fine
13:22 <+postman> thanks to duck for pointing at a few bugs
13:23 <+postman> 4.) i think about offering accountbased routing
13:23 <+postman> like ppl say
13:23 < jrandom> account based routing?
13:23 <+postman> all mail for foo@mail.i2p gets transported to the following destination 
13:23 <+postman> and user presents a valid destination key for it
13:24 <+postman> postman.i2p will then manually route mail to those accounts to mailsystems
13:24 <+postman> just an idea(tm)
13:24 < jrandom> ah nice
13:24 <+postman> i am looking forward to develop and discuss the whole matter
13:25 <+postman> that's it for now
13:25 <+postman> more follows next week
13:25 <+postman> thanks
13:25 < nmi> postman: sorry, transported to a particular i2p destination you mean?
13:25  * postman hands the mike back to jrandom 
13:25 <+postman> nmi: yes
13:25 < ant> <Nightblade> am SMTP i2p destination?
13:25 < ant> <Nightblade> an
13:25 <+postman> nmi: provided the destination accepts smtp and mail for that account
13:25 < jrandom> that sounds very cool, gets rid of the trust aspect of the mail fiiltering
13:26 < nmi> ah, ok. clever. i had thought of doing something similar using mixminion single-use-reply-blocks but your idea is better...
13:26 < jrandom> its probably a lot of work to set up on the client side, but perhaps someone could do some hacking
13:26 <+postman> jrandom: i am working on it
13:26 < jrandom> w00t
13:26 <+postman> jrandom: the user will have the usual webinterface ( acc.html...)
13:27 <+postman> jrandom: and inserts the destinationkey
13:27 < jrandom> well, right, but then there's the MTA configuration
13:27 <+postman> the rest will be done automatigally
13:27 <+postman> yes, on the postman.i2p AND the receiving sinde
13:28 < nmi> jrandom: yeah, it would be cool to have a really stripped down smtp proxy for people not wanting to run a full MTA
13:28 < jrandom> right right
13:28 <+postman> jrandom: i will provide a simple setup config for ppl interested
13:28 <+postman> jrandom: for postfix, exim and sendmail
13:28 <+postman> jrandom: those can be stripped down to BARE necessities
13:28 <@duck> seriously, do you think that there are many users for that?
13:28 < jrandom> postman: this all sounds pretty kickass.  i look forward to hearing more when you're ready
13:29 <+postman> jrandom: no idea about windows smtp servers tho
13:29 <+postman> duck: well
13:29 <+postman> duck: 8 weeks ago there was no need for a mailsystem and no users either
13:29 <+postman> duck: it's investment
13:29 <@duck> true
13:29 <+postman> duck: in 6 months we'll be happy to have it
13:29 < jrandom> duck: the potential comes with moving away from a trusted SMTP filter
13:29 <+postman> :)
13:30 < jrandom> er, perhaps i should say, moving /to/ a trusted smtp filter (no offense postman ;)
13:30 <+postman> and there will be a few ones
13:30 <+postman> AND
13:30 <+postman> (now the punchline)
13:30 <+postman> we could easily create maildomains :)
13:30 <+postman> like duck@duck.i2p and other stuff
13:30 <+postman> :)
13:30 <@duck> ah
13:31 <+postman> the only problem would be the official/private mapping
13:31 < jrandom> hosts.txt!
13:31  * jrandom ducks
13:31 <+postman> but this is another thing for the webmanagement console :)
13:31 <+postman> LOL
13:31 <+postman> jrandom: i rely on shaky sql databases :)
13:31 <@duck> ok; I see it fitting in
13:32 <+postman> ok
13:32 <+postman> then i will work it out and present an concept soon
13:32 <+postman> yess, yet more work
13:32  * postman leans back relaxed
13:32 <+postman> :)
13:32 < jrandom> kickass, thanks postman 
13:33 < jrandom> ok, unless other people have further mail.i2p related questions, shall we move on to 3) i2p-bt?
13:33 < jrandom> consider us moved
13:34 < jrandom> ok, as the email mentioned, i broke the i2p-bt port
13:34  * jrandom hangs head in shame
13:34 < jrandom> in other news, duck, do you have anything wrt i2p-bt you want to discuss?
13:34 <@duck> as a result of jrandom's work not much has been done :)
13:35 <+Ragnarok> booo, hissss
13:35 <@duck> oh Ragnarok had some patches
13:35  * jrandom2p pelts jrandom with tomatoes
13:35 <@duck> I think, see the history file :)
13:35 < jrandom> oh cool
13:35 <@duck> we got some things in the queue too
13:35 <+Ragnarok> well, I was hissing at jr, but ok :)
13:36 <@duck> but I dont want to change (too) much on the unstable ground
13:36 <@duck> (like breaking bt while i2p is getting fixed)
13:36 < jrandom> aye, good plan
13:36 <@duck> .
13:37 < jrandom> ok cool, anyone else have anything on i2p-bt?
13:37 < jrandom> if not, moving us along to 4) eepsites
13:38 < jrandom> well, i know the issues have been discussed a few times since we first got the eepproxy, but there have been some recent queries warranting their mention again
13:39 < bla> yes...
13:39 < jrandom> what we have now for browsing eepsites and normal websites anonymously just plain isn't safe
13:39 < clayboy> disabling java, javascript, cookies and flash helps, though
13:39 < jrandom> DrWoo has done a great job with his page describing the dangers and how you can protect yourself
13:40 < jrandom> right clayboy, definitely
13:40 < clayboy> url?
13:40 < bla> clayboy: Yes, on the HTML side, but not on the HTTP side
13:40 < jrandom> but if there's one thing i've learned with the router console, its that no one follows more than two steps into the instructions ;)
13:40 < clayboy> bla: good point
13:40 < jrandom> clayboy: http://brittanyworld.i2p/browsing/
13:41 < bla> I've done some experiments here: http://forum.i2p/viewtopic.php?t=182
13:41 < bla> Doesn't look good as it is
13:42 <@duck> who has the evil applets?
13:42 < ant> <Nightblade> there was a security exploit found in java
13:43 < ant> <Nightblade> for some older 1.4.x vers
13:43 < ant> <Nightblade> not 1.5
13:44 < jrandom> nightblade: the 'attack' used in this person's case was really trivial, and, according to the person, worked from 1.1.6-1.5
13:44 < ant> <Nightblade> hmm
13:44 < jrandom> (download a .exe, run the .exe)
13:45 < jrandom> i was suprised to see some java security permissions fire up on instantiation of new File(filename) but no security permissions fire up on instantiation of new FileOutputStream(filename)
13:45  * jrandom stops handing out hand grenades
13:46 < jrandom> (i havent verified their code, but did see much of it)
13:46 < jrandom> but anyway, eepsites
13:47 < jrandom> well, i dont think it would be prudent to remove the eepproxy altogether
13:47 < jrandom> but i dont really have time right now to implement any of the solutions listed
13:48 < bla> jrandom: Stripping out all Accept* headers would be a good thing, for now
13:48 < jrandom> what do y'all think?  any volunteers?  shall we wing it until we do get time?
13:48 < ant> <Nightblade> bla: I don't think it is a big deal that people can see some browser headers
13:49 < ant> <Nightblade> millions of people use those browsers
13:49 < bla> And always adding a User-Agent: header, even if the client didn't send one. I makes requests homogeneous
13:50 < bla> Nighblade: Yes, but if your browser says Accept-Language: xx (just made up on the spot), and there happens to be only 1 I2P node in a country that speaks language xx, almonimity is gone, completely
13:50 < bla> The Accept-Language: header is there though, in some browsers. And we can't rely on it always being "en"
13:50 < ant> <Nightblade> ok but what if removing some of those headers violates the HTTP spec?
13:50 < jrandom> adding those two cases are easy enough, and i'll get them into 0.4.2.1, but it really isn't safe to explicitly filter headers like this
13:50 < jrandom> nightblade: we break so many aspects of the HTTP spec it hurts
13:51 < bla> Nightblade: Only one of the threee browsers I listed did send the header, so it shouldn't be much of a problem
13:51 < ant> <Connelly> HTTP was not designed for anonymity
13:51 < jrandom> the eepproxy is duct tape and shoe polish
13:51 < bla> jrandom: Why isn't that filttering safe?
13:52 < bla> jrandom: We could even consider stripping _all_ headeers, except for the Host: header and the GET header
13:52 < jrandom> bla: stripping all headers except the host would be safer, yes
13:52 < bla> jrandom: After all, what do we need more for an anonymous HTTP?
13:52 < jrandom> but thats beyond the amount of time i can put into it
13:52 < jrandom> i can add the Accept and user-agent filters in ~ 30s
13:53 < jrandom> much beyond that and i throw my hands in the air and rewrite the http proxy ;)
13:53 < bla> jrandom: How come stripping all of them is more difficult?
13:53 < jrandom> read the code.  
13:54 < jrandom> (patches welcome)
13:54 < jrandom> but what we're looking at here is still just a short term solution
13:54 < bla> jrandom: Point well taken ;)  But seriously: I think the Accept* and User-Agent fixes would do really fine for now
13:54 < jrandom> we need someone to work on something that will last us long term
13:55 < ant> * dm just ate 20 slices of cheese... drool.
13:55 < jrandom> bla: i heard that last time someone asked us to filter the User-agent and referrer headers ;)
13:55 < jrandom> (but yeah, i'll get those two into the next rev)
13:56 < ant> <dm> those headers are usefl
13:56 < ant> <dm> useful
13:56 < ant> <dm> For service providers.
13:56 < jrandom> yes, they are
13:57 < jrandom> we've already had some apps break because we filter referrer too
13:57 < bla> dmm: Yes, indeed. However, they also provide a browser or OS fingerprint
13:57 < ant> <dm> I have an idea!
13:57  * jrandom takes cover
13:58 < ant> <dm> Hard code the User-Agent to: Nokia6230/2.0 (03.15) Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 149.254.201.133 
13:58 < ant> <dm> eh? eh?
13:58 < jrandom> we already hard code the user agent header
13:59 < ant> <Nightblade> I2P-enabled cell phones
13:59  * jrandom mounts a DoS on that phone
13:59 < ant> <dm> To what?
13:59 < ant> <dm> My poor phone!!!
13:59 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have any thoughts on the eepproxy/eepsite stuff?
14:00 < bla> MYOB/6.ss (AN/ON)
14:00 < bla> no\
14:00 <+Ragnarok> we should reinvent html using s-expressions!
14:01 < jrandom> (i really do think using a bbcode style macro language is the way to go, at least for some things ;)
14:01 < jrandom> ((or xml for you geeks))
14:02 < ant> <dm> Microsoft endorses use of XML
14:02 < ant> <dm> So I'm all for it.
14:02 <+Ragnarok> xml is just excessively wordy s-expressions :)
14:03 < ant> <dm> Is this a good time for me to aplaud jrandom for his work on this project?
14:03  * jrandom volunteers Ragnarok to work on it, after getting the next gen address book ;)
14:03 <@duck> I dont think that 'invent your own markup language' will work for general browsers
14:04 <@duck> maybe for the blog thing inside myi2p
14:04 <+Ragnarok> it's always a good time :)
14:04 < ant> <dm> applaud even
14:04 < jrandom> duck: the proxy will need to filter content anyway, it would be simple enough (heh) to inject the results of macro expansions into the resulting filtered content
14:05 < ant> * dm tips his hat to jr.
14:05 < jrandom> gracias dm et al
14:05 < ant> <Nightblade> something like PDF would be safer than HTML
14:05 < jrandom> lol
14:05 <@duck> .txt files!
14:06 < ant> <Nightblade> i've seem PDF files with clickable links, but the files themselves are huge
14:06 < ant> <Nightblade> seen
14:06 < ant> <dm> Uncompressed Bitmaps?
14:06 < jrandom> yes, lets all write in pdf
14:07 <+Ragnarok> erg, postscript is fugly
14:07 < ant> <cat-a-puss> how is html insecure?
14:07 <@duck> anyway
14:07 < ant> <Nightblade> cat: with javascript, activex, applets,...
14:07 < jrandom> cat-a-puss: all the different ways to encode dangerous data
14:08 < ant> <dm> languages aren't secure or insecure, clients are.
14:08 <+Ragnarok> the realy problem is how to do anon dhtml...
14:08 < jrandom> (and we'll never, /never/ be ahead of the game as long as we explicitly filter)
14:08 < ant> <cat-a-puss> Java/javascript are enclosed in tags. So strip those out, plain html is not harmful right?
14:08 < ant> <dm> We need to use a data format that is parsed by a client made by a company that we trust.
14:08 < jrandom> Ragnarok: macros, and/or reference known safe and locally installed javascript
14:08 < ant> <dm> I trust Microsoft, therefore I suggest Internet Explorer, Microsoft Word, or Notepad
14:09 < ant> <dm> Flight Simulator 2002 is acceptable as well.
14:09 < ant> <cat-a-puss> Freenet already has an "anonymity filter" strips out all Java / Javascript / ActiveX etc. Borrow that and the only thing I can think could get through would be Image exploits... unless there is something I am missing.
14:10 < jrandom> freenet's anon filter is a good start for one or two of the different camps, but would likely require some work to get forms working as we want them
14:10 < ant> <Nightblade> the eepproxy would have to run as a separate process, because of licensing
14:11 < jrandom> that still leaves us a heavily crippled html
14:11 < jrandom> (with no css)
14:11 < ant> <dm> Okay, how about Flash?
14:11 < jrandom> nightblade: we can work around that (same way we work around i2ptunnel being GPL)
14:11 < ant> <dm> Imagine a world wide web with only flash.
14:11 < ant> <dm> What a rich and wonderful world that would be.
14:12 < ant> <Nightblade> well Just create a warning: "Eepsite browsing is hazardous to your anonymity.  Please use Gopher."
14:12 < ant> <Nightblade> actually gopher is not a bad idea
14:12  * jrandom ports archie
14:12 <+Ragnarok> gopher!
14:12 < ant> <dm> There was Betty as well, wasn't there...
14:12 <+Ragnarok> I remember gopher :)
14:13 <+Ragnarok> man, those were the good old days.  I think I had a screaming 14.4 baud at the time... <sigh>
14:13 < ant> <Nightblade> I only browsed gopher in text mode, and I don't know if it supported graphics
14:13 < jrandom> they didnt have gui browsers last time i used gopher ;)
14:14 < jrandom> anyway, there are lots of options
14:14 < ant> <Nightblade> what was that browser called back then?  the one before Netscape...
14:14 < ant> <Nightblade> i forget
14:14 < jrandom> mosaic
14:15 < ant> <Nightblade> yeah
14:15 < ant> <dm> Mosaic 2.0
14:15 < ant> <Nightblade> "Welcome to I2P, please wait while we install Gopher and Mosaic."
14:15 < jrandom> heh
14:15 < jrandom> yeah, probably no javascript exploits in those
14:16 < jrandom> ok, anyway, thats that, i suppose
14:16 < jrandom> moving on to 5) ???
14:16 <+Ragnarok> there's still a gopher package in debian
14:16 < jrandom> anyone have anything else (not gopher related)?
14:17 < ant> <dm> What will happen to I2P when you need to start working again?
14:18 < jrandom> i'll be on i2p fulltime through the spring, at least.  we can discuss things beyond then as that time approaches
14:19 < ant> <dm> o k
14:19 < jrandom> in any case, if i got hit by a bus tomorrow, everything is in cvs and all code is free
14:19 <+Ragnarok> I assume you're planning to have a 1.0 before then.  What do you think the odds are?
14:19 <+Ragnarok> before spring, not your untimely demise...
14:20 < jrandom> certainty.
14:20 < ant> <dm> ahaha.. yes, what are the odds of 1.0 before tomorrow when you get hit by that bus?
14:20 < jrandom> (assuming no buses ;)
14:20 < ant> <dm> I just had a very sad thought.
14:20 < ant> <dm> Depressing really, but... If you were to get hit by a bus, no one here would know of it.
14:20 < ant> <cat-a-puss> On filtering: What if we created a better proxy, such that all the applications on the computer's traffic could go through it, then we would not need to filter Javascript et alt because they can't find out who we are anyway.
14:21 < ant> <dm> You would just die, and we wouldn't know what happened :(
14:21 < ant> <dm> God why did he have to die?!?!? why?!?!
14:22 < ant> <dm> Can you put a clause in your will to email the mailing list if you die?
14:22 < jrandom> cat-a-puss: javascript can send the contennts of your bookmarks, your IP address, and all sorts of things to a remote site
14:22 < jrandom> dm: people who know me irl know i'm involved in i2p.  enough of this morbid shit
14:23 < ant> <dm> ah cool.
14:24 < ant> <cat-a-puss> jrandom: yeah, but that sort of thing requres an exploit right, not just say forwarding them to some page that uses a different protocall that is not proxied. We probably be reasonable safe from those with a scanner on incomming content and automatic updates.
14:25 < jrandom> cat-a-puss: erm, perhaps i misunderstood - are you suggesting that it may be safe to have javascript enabled in the browser, as long as the connections that that javascript code makes are proxied also?
14:26 < ant> <cat-a-puss> jrandom: yeah, as long as there is no buffer overflows etc.
14:26 < jrandom> if so, thats still vulnerable to plain old javascript that reads the javascrip environment and sends it "anonymously" to http://cia.i2p/data.  
14:27 < jrandom> the data available to javascript includes your IP address, as well as your bookmarks and all sorts of other things
14:27 < jrandom> so even though the connection to cia.i2p was anonymous, the content exposes you
14:31 < jrandom> ok, anyone else have something to bring up for the meeting?
14:31 <@duck> yes:
14:31 <@duck> what does the new 'active peers' counter mean
14:31 < jrandom> ah
14:31 < jrandom> yeah, that changed
14:32 < jrandom> in 0.4.2.1, the new Active: x/y will have x=# of peers you've sent or received a message from successfully in the last minute, y=# peers seen in the last hour or so
14:32 < jrandom> this is part of the code to deal with some peers giving out bad info in the IP autodetection phase
14:33  * duck will try to remember it
14:33 < jrandom> so it'll vary much more than before
14:33 < jrandom> heh so dont worry when the value is lower than you're used to ;)
14:34 < jrandom> ok, if thats it, then y'all should check back onto the mailing list and website over the next day for the 0.4.2.1 release
14:34 < jrandom> it'll be backwards compatible, blah blah blah
14:34 < jrandom> in any case
14:34  * jrandom winds up
14:35  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
