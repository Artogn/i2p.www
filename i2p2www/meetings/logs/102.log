14:04 < jrandom> 0) hi
14:04 < jrandom> 1) 0.3.4.1 status
14:04 < jrandom> 2) Updated docs
14:04 < jrandom> 3) 0.4 progress
14:04 < jrandom> 4) ???
14:04 < jrandom> 0) hi
14:04  * jrandom waves
14:04 < jrandom> weekly status notes just posted a few seconds ago @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-August/000404.html
14:04 < deer> <mrflibble> ooh
14:04  * jrandom will give y'all a sec to pull those up ;)
14:05 < jrandom> anyway, while y'all are reading, might as well swing into 1) 0.3.4.1 status
14:05 < jrandom> 0.3.4.1 is out, as you've seen
14:06 < jrandom> its only been a day or two though, but its generally seemed to be going pretty well, at least, up through a few hours ago
14:07 < jrandom> there are a pair of bugs just recently tracked down (and fixed locally, testing ongoing), and those are pretty substantial, so we'll be seeing a new release in a day or two
14:07 < jrandom> has anyone had any problems with the new web console?
14:07 < jrandom> (or, more specifically, has anyone tried it and had problems?  :)(
14:07 < deer> <oOo> Tried it, work well ^^
14:07 < jrandom> w3rd
14:08 < deer> <oOo> Even without any Java compiler ^^
14:08 < jrandom> nice, yeah, it should precompile all the JSPs so people won't need javac
14:08 < jrandom> thats one thing that web app devs will need to do, but its really really easy, especially with ant
14:09 < jrandom> (template code to do it is in i2p/apps/routerconsole/java/build.xml in the 'precompilejsp' target)
14:09 < deer> <identiguy> jrandom, what are your concerns about outproxies?
14:09 < jrandom> i've also added in optional basic HTTP authentication to protect the console, so you'll be able to have it listen on 0.0.0.0 and access it remotely
14:10 < jrandom> oh, my concerns w/ outproxies are threefold - the cost (technical and social) of maangement, the security (outproxies get cleartext), and the anonymity (when you leave a mixnet, you are much more vulnerable to attack)
14:10 < deer> <oOo> The servlet console misses a few stats from :7655 (memory consumption), and may some other stuff (shitlist), but it's great ^^
14:11 < deer> <identiguy> Thanks. Just wondering.
14:11 < jrandom> "private" outproxies are different though - e.g. an anonymizer.i2p could work great without requiring trust
14:11 < jrandom> (but still limiting access to pseudonymously known clients, etc)
14:12 < jrandom> ah right oOo, I'm going to add in a new page that mirrors the old one
14:12 < jrandom> or would you suggest a new page for more stats?  could you draft up what you'd like it to look like?
14:12 < jrandom> (or even code it?  :)
14:12 < deer> <oOo> Well, it could have been left as an exrcercice for the reader ;)
14:12 < jrandom> lol
14:13 < deer> <oOo> I was only thinking of memory consumption (on main page) and a Shitlist tab, that's all _I_ miss
14:13 < deer> <oOo> Might need to add shitlist reason to shitlisting, BTW ;)
14:13 < jrandom> we could probably toss the detailed shitlist into the peer profile page
14:14 < jrandom> we dont actually keep track of that right now, but you're right, we could and it'd be nice
14:14 < deer> <oOo> IMHO the peer profile page is too big to be really usefull :*)
14:14 < deer> <oOo> And easy to do, every code to .addshitlist() stuff have good comments just the next line ;)
14:14 < jrandom> any suggestions on improvement?
14:15 < jrandom> heh :)
14:15 < jrandom> (the netDb page imho is pretty nasty)
14:16 < jrandom> hi fvw 
14:16 < fvw> heyas jrandom, everyone.
14:16 < jrandom> ok, well, if anyone has any more suggestions for the web side, please let me know
14:16 < jrandom> this new web console is really just a first pass at things, and most of my attention has been paid to the configuration side
14:17 < jrandom> ok, anyone have anything else to bring up wrt 0.3.4.1?
14:17 < jrandom> ok, moving on to 2) Updated docs
14:17 < jrandom> [see email for list of updated pages]
14:18 < jrandom> we've finally gotten all the details out of the paypal/e-gold accts as well (sorry for the delay!)
14:19 < cervantes> w00t
14:19 < jrandom> another aspect of the docs not mentioned is what we should ship with the router - on the new web console, we can easily package up any html / jsp files to serve as context sensitive help
14:19 < cervantes> sheeeit....did I really donate all that
14:20 < jrandom> cervantes definitely gets the cervantes++ this week :)
14:20 < cervantes> must have miscounted my foreign currency ;-)
14:20 < jrandom> lol
14:20  * fvw cheers for cervantes.
14:20 < jrandom> mos def
14:20 < cervantes> btw I've found an old stash of hungarian dollars....
14:21 < jrandom> lol do you keep these under your mattress or something?
14:21 < cervantes> or forints ..
14:21 < cervantes> I always overestimate my holiday spending ;-)
14:21 < jrandom> heh
14:22 < fvw> hmm, forints. How odd.
14:22  * fvw mumbles "forinti=0..."
14:23 < jrandom> (no wonder hungarian notation doesn't use 'i')
14:23 < jrandom> </derail>
14:23 < fvw> hehe. Yes, getting back on track. New docs. very pretty.
14:23 < jrandom> w3rd
14:23 < deer> <kling> g`evening 
14:24 < jrandom> there is still much to be cleaned up, so hopefully people can take a page or two and give it a once over, sending in your results / updates
14:24 < jrandom> hi kling
14:24 < jrandom> ok, anything else wrt docs?
14:24 < fvw> pweh
14:25 < jrandom> if not, moving on to 3) 0.4 progress
14:25 < fvw> perhaps not totally on topic, but the download page needs some work too.
14:25 < jrandom> ah
14:25 < jrandom> yeah
14:25 < deer> <oOo> Missings Bounties deatails ? ;)
14:25 < jrandom> that particular page i'm not /too/ worried about, since it'll all be changing with the new installer, so we'll have to rewrite it anyway
14:25 < fvw> I'll kick it a bit and ask the necessary questions on the mailinglist.
14:25 < jrandom> r0x0r fvw
14:25 < fvw> oh, ok. Then I won't,.
14:26 < deer> <kling> router still up nothing special to report Uptime 32h
14:26 < jrandom> yeah, we'll still have some of that info, but most will change
14:26 < jrandom> nice kling - are you on 0.3.4.1 or 0.3.4?
14:26 < deer> <kling> .1
14:26 < jrandom> oOo: unfortunately, we lost most of the details pages
14:27 < jrandom> but you're right, we need some filler there
14:27 < deer> <oOo> Ok, too bad but can live without them ^^
14:27 < jrandom> or to remove the links
14:27 < jrandom> that also reminds me that aum is now working on a DHT, and it seems Nightblade isn't anymore
14:27 < jrandom> (so the distributed data store 'dev' should be updated)
14:29 < jrandom> ok, anway, the 0.4 stuff is coming along - i smacked around a 100 router sim the other day with a few different bandwidth loads, and it held up pretty well
14:29 < jrandom> also fixed a nasty bug in kaffe's jthread scheduler, but there is still some funkiness on fbsd there (but not on linux)
14:30 < jrandom> i dont know how things are coming with the installer..
14:30 < jrandom> but i do recall hypercubus working on it today, so i'm sure we'll find out more when more is ready to be found out
14:31 < deer> <oOo> Hehe
14:31 < jrandom> does anyone have any questions / concerns / suggestions wrt the 0.4 rev?
14:31 < deer> <oOo> "When ?" J/K ;)
14:32 < jrandom> we really don't have much more to add to the code before its ready for 0.4
14:32 < jrandom> (but its not like 0.4 is the end game, we've got a truckload more to do after it)
14:32 < deer> <oOo> To Infinity and Beyond !
14:32 < jrandom> exactly ;)
14:33 < jrandom> ok, I guess thats all I've got to bring up, so 4) ???
14:33 < jrandom> anyone have anything they want to discuss?
14:33 < deer> <oOo> i2pcvs.i2p  revival ?
14:34 < jrandom> yeah, i should probably start that up again
14:34 < jrandom> probably will once we bundle the new router console as primary, with the i2ptunnel.cfg
14:35 < deer> <oOo> Ok, thanks
14:36 < jrandom> ok, if there's nothing else...
14:36  * jrandom winds up
14:36  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed
