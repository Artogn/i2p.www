<p>{% trans -%}
For a future of I2P and attract more people
into I2P I withdrawal the vuze bounty and offer a IPv6 bounty.
To claim this bounty, the I2P router needs to run full on native
IPv6 connections like it does on IPv4.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<br>
Bounty is done as of I2P 0.9.8 and money paid to the I2P team.
<br>
As a extension to this bounty, a new bounty was created out of this.
This new bounty included running a IPv6 router for some time in 2013.
That timeframe is already over and the participants were paid out.
Read more about this in the <a href="http://echelon.i2p/bounty/ipv6bounty.txt">
IPv6 bounty rules</a> on echelon.i2p.
