<p>
The main I2P development branch (<code>i2p.i2p</code>) has been set up to enable developers to easily set up two of the commonly-used IDEs for Java development: Eclipse and NetBeans.
</p>

<h1>Eclipse</h1>

<p>
The main I2P development branches (<code>i2p.i2p</code> and branches from it) contain .project and .classpath Eclipse files, to enable the branch to be easily set up in Eclipse.
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Check out the I2P branch into some directory (e.g. <code>$HOME/dev/i2p.i2p</code>).
</li>

<li>
Open Eclipse and create a new Workspace, based in the directory that the I2P branch was checked out to.
</li>

<li>
Select "File - Import..." and then under "General" select "Existing Projects into Workspace".
</li>

<li>
For "Select root directory:" choose the directory that the I2P branch was checked out to.
</li>

<li>
If necessary, click "Refresh" to refresh the list of projects.
</li>

<li>
Select every project in the list, and click "Finish".
</li>

<li>
Done! Your workspace should now contain all projects within the I2P branch, and their build dependencies should be correctly set up.
</li>

</ol>

<h1>NetBeans</h1>

<p>
The main I2P development branches (<code>i2p.i2p</code> and branches from it) contain NetBeans project files.
