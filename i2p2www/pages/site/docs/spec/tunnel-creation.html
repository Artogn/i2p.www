This page documents the current tunnel build implementation.

<h2 id="tunnelCreate.overview">Tunnel Creation Specification</h2>

<p>
This document specifies the details of the encrypted tunnel build messages
used to create tunnels using a "non-interactive telescoping" method.
See <a href="{{ site_url('docs/tunnels/implementation') }}">the tunnel build document</a>
for an overview of the process, including peer selection and ordering methods.

<p>The tunnel creation is accomplished by a single message passed along
the path of peers in the tunnel, rewritten in place, and transmitted
back to the tunnel creator.  This single tunnel message is made up
of a variable number of records (up to 8) - one for each potential peer in
the tunnel.   Individual records are asymmetrically
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#elgamal">(ElGamal)</a>
encrypted to be
read only by a specific peer along the path, while an additional
symmetric layer of encryption
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#AES">(AES)</a>
is added at each hop so as to expose
the asymmetrically encrypted record only at the appropriate time.</p>

<h3 id="number">Number of Records</h3>
Not all records must contain valid data.
The build message for a 3-hop tunnel, for example, may contain more records
to hide the actual length of the tunnel from the participants.
There are two build message types. The original
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#msg_TunnelBuild">Tunnel Build Message</a> (TBM)
contains 8 records, which is more than enough for any practical tunnel length.
The recently-implemented
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#msg_VariableTunnelBuild">Variable Tunnel Build Message</a> (VTBM)
contains 1 to 8 records. The originator may trade off the size of the message
with the desired amount of tunnel length obfuscation.
<p>
In the current network, most tunnels are 2 or 3 hops long.
The current implementation uses a 5-record VTBM to build tunnels of 4 hops or less,
and the 8-record TBM for longer tunnels.
The 5-record VTBM (which, when fragmented, fits in three 1KB tunnel messaages) reduces network traffic
and increases  build sucess rate, because smaller messages are less likely to be dropped.
<p>
The reply message must be the same type and length as the build message.


<h3 id="tunnelCreate.requestRecord">Request Record Specification</h3>

Also specified in the
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#struct_BuildRequestRecord">I2NP Specification</a>

<p>Cleartext of the record, visible only to the hop being asked:</p><pre>
  bytes     0-3: tunnel ID to receive messages as
  bytes    4-35: local router identity hash
  bytes   36-39: next tunnel ID
  bytes   40-71: next router identity hash
  bytes  72-103: AES-256 tunnel layer key
  bytes 104-135: AES-256 tunnel IV key
  bytes 136-167: AES-256 reply key
  bytes 168-183: AES-256 reply IV
  byte      184: flags
  bytes 185-188: request time (in hours since the epoch)
  bytes 189-192: next message ID
  bytes 193-221: uninterpreted / random padding</pre>

<p>The next tunnel ID and next router identity hash fields are used to
specify the next hop in the tunnel, though for an outbound tunnel
endpoint, they specify where the rewritten tunnel creation reply
message should be sent.  In addition, the next message ID specifies the
message ID that the message (or reply) should use.</p>

<p>The flags field contains the following:
<pre>
 Bit order: 76543210 (bit 7 is MSB)
 bit 7: if set, allow messages from anyone
 bit 6: if set, allow messages to anyone, and send the reply to the
        specified next hop in a Tunnel Build Reply Message
 bits 5-0: Undefined
</pre>

Bit 7 indicates that the hop will be an inbound gateway (IBGW).
Bit 6 indicates that the hop will be an outbound endpoint (OBEP).
If neither bit is set, the hop will be an intermediate participant.

<h4>Request Record Creation</h4>
<p>
Every hop gets a random Tunnel ID.
The current and next-hop Tunnel IDs are filled in.
Every record gets a random tunnel IV key, and reply IV.
The layer and reply key pairs are generated.
</p>


<h4 id="encryption">Request Record Encryption</h4>

<p>That cleartext record is <a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#elgamal">ElGamal 2048 encrypted</a> with the hop's
public encryption key and formatted into a 528 byte record:</p><pre>
  bytes   0-15: First 16 bytes of the SHA-256 of the current hop's router identity
  bytes 16-527: ElGamal-2048 encrypted request record</pre>

In the 512-byte encrypted record,
the ElGamal data contains bytes 1-256 and 258-513 of the
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#elgamal">514-byte ElGamal encrypted block</a>.
The two padding bytes from the block (the zero bytes at locations 0 and 257) are removed.

<p>Since the cleartext uses the full field, there is no need for
additional padding beyond <code>SHA256(cleartext) + cleartext</code>.</p>

<p>
Each 528-byte record is then iteratively encrypted
(using AES decryption, with the reply key and reply IV for each hop) so that the router identity will only be in cleartext
for the hop in question.
</p>

<h3 id="tunnelCreate.hopProcessing">Hop Processing and Encryption</h3>

<p>When a hop receives a TunnelBuildMessage, it looks through the
records contained within it for one starting with their own identity
hash (trimmed to 8 bytes).  It then decrypts the ElGamal block from
that record and retrieves the protected cleartext.  At that point,
they make sure the tunnel request is not a duplicate by feeding the 
AES-256 reply key into a bloom filter.
Duplicates or invalid requests
are dropped.</p>

<p>After deciding whether they will agree to participate in the tunnel
or not, they replace the record that had contained the request with
an encrypted reply block.  All other records are <a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#AES">AES-256
encrypted</a> with the included reply key and IV. Each is
encrypted separately, rather than chained across records.</p>

<p>
Each hop knows only its own response.
If it agrees, it will maintain the tunnel until expiration,
even if it will not be used,
as it cannot know whether all other hops agreed.
</p>


<h4 id="tunnelCreate.replyRecord">Reply Record Specification</h4>

<p>After the current hop reads their record, they replace it with a
reply record stating whether or not they agree to participate in the
tunnel, and if they do not, they classify their reason for
rejection.  This is simply a 1 byte value, with 0x0 meaning they
agree to participate in the tunnel, and higher values meaning higher
levels of rejection.
<p>
The following rejection codes are defined:
<ul>
<li>
TUNNEL_REJECT_PROBABALISTIC_REJECT = 10
<li>
TUNNEL_REJECT_TRANSIENT_OVERLOAD = 20
<li>
TUNNEL_REJECT_BANDWIDTH = 30
<li>
TUNNEL_REJECT_CRIT = 50
</ul>
To hide other causes, such as router shutdown, from peers, the current implementation
uses TUNNEL_REJECT_BANDWIDTH for almost all rejections.

<p>
  The reply is encrypted with the AES session
key delivered to it in the encrypted block, padded with 527 bytes of random data
to reach the full record size.
The padding is placed before the status byte:
</p><pre>
  AES-256-CBC(SHA-256(padding+status) + padding + status, key, IV)</pre>
This is also described in the
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#msg_TunnelBuildReply">I2NP spec</a>.

<h3 id="tunnelCreate.requestPreparation">Tunnel Build Message Preparation</h3>

<p>When building a new Tunnel Build Messaage, all of the Build Request Records must first be 
built and asymmetrically encrypted using
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#elgamal">ElGamal</a>.
Each record is then
premptively decrypted with the reply keys and IVs of the hops earlier in the
path, using
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/cryptography') }}#AES">AES</a>.
That decryption should be run in reverse order so that the
asymmetrically encrypted data will show up in the clear at the
right hop after their predecessor encrypts it.</p>

<p>The excess records not needed for individual requests are simply
filled with random data by the creator.</p>

<h3 id="tunnelCreate.requestDelivery">Tunnel Build Message Delivery</h3>

<p>For outbound tunnels, the delivery is done directly from the tunnel
creator to the first hop, packaging up the TunnelBuildMessage as if
the creator was just another hop in the tunnel.  For inbound
tunnels, the delivery is done through an existing outbound tunnel.
The outbound tunnel is generally from the same pool as the new tunnel being built.
If no outbound tunnel is available in that pool, an outbound exploratory tunnel is used.
At startup, when no outbound exploratory tunnel exists yet, a fake 0-hop
outbound tunnel is used.</p>

<h3 id="tunnelCreate.endpointHandling">Tunnel Build Message Endpoint Handling</h3>

<p>
For creation of an outbound tunnel,
when the request reaches an outbound endpoint (as determined by the
'allow messages to anyone' flag), the hop is processed as usual,
encrypting a reply in place of the record and encrypting all of the
other records, but since there is no 'next hop' to forward the
TunnelBuildMessage on to, it instead places the encrypted reply
records into a
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#msg_TunnelBuildReply">TunnelBuildReplyMessage</a>
or
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#msg_VariableTunnelBuildReply">VariableTunnelBuildReplyMessage</a>
(the type of message and number of records must match that of the request)
and delivers it to the
reply tunnel specified within the request record.  That reply tunnel
forwards the Tunnel Build Reply Message back to the tunnel creator,
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/tunnels/implementation') }}#tunnel.operation">just as for any other message</a>.
The tunnel creator then
processes it, as described below.</p>

<p>The reply tunnel was selected by the creator as follows:
Generally it is an inbound tunnel from the same pool as the new outbound tunnel being built.
If no inbound tunnel is available in that pool, an inbound exploratory tunnel is used.
At startup, when no inbound exploratory tunnel exists yet, a fake 0-hop
inbound tunnel is used.</p>

<p>
For creation of an inbound tunnel,
when the request reaches the inbound endpoint (also known as the
tunnel creator), there is no need to generate an explicit Tunnel Build Reply Message, and
the router processes each of the replies, as below.</p>

<h3 id="tunnelCreate.replyProcessing">Tunnel Build Reply Message Processing</h3>

<p>To process the reply records, the creator simply has to AES decrypt
each record individually, using the reply key and IV of each hop in
the tunnel after the peer (in reverse order).  This then exposes the
reply specifying whether they agree to participate in the tunnel or
why they refuse.  If they all agree, the tunnel is considered
created and may be used immediately, but if anyone refuses, the
tunnel is discarded.</p>

<p>
The agreements and rejections are noted in each peer's
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/peer-selection') }}">profile</a>, to be used in future assessments
of peer tunnel capacity.


<h2 id="tunnelCreate.notes">History and Notes</h2>
<p>
This strategy came about during a discussion on the I2P mailing list
    between Michael Rogers, Matthew Toseland (toad), and jrandom regarding
    the predecessor attack.  See: <ul>
    <li><a href="http://osdir.com/ml/network.i2p/2005-10/msg00138.html">Summary</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://osdir.com/ml/network.i2p/2005-10/msg00129.html">Reasoning</a></li>
    </ul></li>
It was introduced in release 0.6.1.10 on 2006-02-16, which was the last time
a non-backward-compatible change was made in I2P.
</p>

<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>This design does not prevent two hostile peers within a tunnel from
tagging one or more request or reply records to detect that they are
within the same tunnel, but doing so can be detected by the tunnel
creator when reading the reply, causing the tunnel to be marked as 
invalid.</li>
<li>This design does not include a proof of work on the asymmetrically
encrypted section, though the 16 byte identity hash could be cut in
half with the latter replaced by a hashcash function of up to 2^64
cost.</li>
<li>This design alone does not prevent two hostile peers within a tunnel from
using timing information to determine whether they are in the same
tunnel.  The use of batched and synchronized request delivery
could help (batching up requests and sending them off on the
(ntp-synchronized) minute).  However, doing so lets peers 'tag' the
requests by delaying them and detecting the delay later in the
tunnel, though perhaps dropping requests not delivered in a small
window would work (though doing that would require a high degree of
clock synchronization).  Alternately, perhaps individual hops could
inject a random delay before forwarding on the request?</li>
<li>Are there any nonfatal methods of tagging the request?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In the current implementation, the originator leaves one record empty
for itself. Thus a message of n records can only build a
tunnel of n-1 hops.
This appears to be necessary for inbound tunnels (where the next-to-last hop
can see the hash prefix for the next hop), but not for outbound tunnels.
This is to be researched and verified.
If it is possible to use the remaining record without compromising anonymity,
we should do so.
<li>
The usefulness of a timestamp with an hour resolution is questionable,
and the constraint is not currently enforced.
Therefore the request time field is unused.
This should be researched and possibly changed.

</li><li>
The Bloom filter rotation time should be evaluated.
</li><li>
Use only VTBM; do not select old peers that don't support it.
