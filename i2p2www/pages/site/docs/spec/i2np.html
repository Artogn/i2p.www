<p>
The I2P Network Protocol (I2NP),
which is sandwiched between I2CP and the various I2P transport protocols, manages the
routing and mixing of messages between routers, as well as the selection of what
transports to use when communicating with a peer for which there are multiple
common transports supported.
</p>

<h2 id="versions">Protocol Versions</h2>
<p>
All routers must publish their I2NP protocol version in the "router.version" field in the RouterInfo properties.
This version field indicates their level of support for various I2NP protocol features,
and is not necessarily the actual router version.
</p><p>
If alternative (non-Java) routers
wish to publish any version information about the actual router implementation,
they must do so in another property.
Versions other than those listed below are allowed. Support will be
determined through a numeric comparison; for example, 0.9.13 implies support for 0.9.12 features.
Note that the "coreVersion" property is not used for determination of the I2NP protocol version.
</p><p>
A basic summary of the I2NP protocol versions is as follows. For details, see below.

<h2 id="structures">Common structures</h2>
The following structures are elements of multiple I2NP messages.
They are not complete messages.

<h3 id="struct_I2NPMessageHeader">I2NP message header</h3>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
  Common header to all I2NP messages, which contains important information like a checksum, expiration date, etc.
</p>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<p>
  1 byte <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Integer">Integer</a> specifying the type of this message,
 followed by a 4 byte <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Integer">Integer</a> specifying the message-id.
 After that there is an expiration <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Date">Date</a>,
 followed by a 2 byte <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Integer">Integer</a> specifying
 the length of the message payload, followed by a <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Hash">Hash</a>,
 which is truncated to the first byte. After that the actual message data follows.

<h4>Definition</h4>
<pre>
type :: `Integer`
        length -> 1 byte
        
        purpose -> identifies the message type (see table below)

msg_id :: `Integer`
          length -> 4 bytes

          purpose -> uniquely identifies this message (for some time at least)
                     This is usually a locally-generated random number, but for
                     outgoing tunnel build messages it may be derived from
                     the incoming message. See below.

expiration :: `Date`
           8 bytes
           date this message will expire

short_expiration :: `Integer`
           4 bytes
           date this message will expire (seconds since the epoch)

size :: `Integer`
        length -> 2 bytes
        
        purpose -> length of the payload

chks :: `Integer`
        length -> 1 byte
     
        purpose -> checksum of the payload
                   SHA256 hash truncated to the first byte

data :: Data
        length -> $size bytes
        
        purpose -> actual message contents
</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul><li>
When transmitted over <a href="{{ site_url('docs/transport/ssu') }}">SSU</a>,
the 16-byte standard header is not used.
Only a 1-byte type and a 4-byte expiration in seconds is included.
The message id and size are
incorporated into various parts of the SSU data packet format.
The checksum is not required since errors are caught in decryption.
</li><li>
The standard header is also required for I2NP messages contained in other messages and structures
(Data, TunnelData, TunnelGateway, and GarlicClove).
As of release 0.8.12, to reduce overhead, checksum verification is disabled at
some places in the protocol stack.
However, for compatibility with older versions, checksum generation is still required.
It is a topic for future research to determine points in the protocol stack
where the far-end router's version is known and checksum generation can be disabled.

Expiration :: `Date` (8 bytes)

Certificate :: Always NULL in the current implementation (3 bytes total, all zeroes)

</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
  Cloves are never fragmented.
  When used in a Garlic Clove, the first bit of the Delivery Instructions flag byte specifies encryption.
  If this bit is 0, the clove is not encrypted.
  If 1, the clove is encrypted, and a 32 byte Session Key immediately follows the flag byte.
  Clove encryption is not fully implemented.
<li>
  See also the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/garlic-routing') }}">garlic routing specification</a>.
<li>
  Maximum length is a function of the total length of all the cloves and the
  maximum length of the GarlicMessage.
<li>
  In the future, the certificate could possibly be used for a HashCash to "pay" for the routing.
<li>
  The message can be any I2NP message (including a GarlicMessage, although that is not used in practice).
  The messages used in practice are DataMessage, DeliveryStatusMessage, and DatabaseStoreMessage.
<li>
  The Clove ID is generally set to a random number on transmit and is checked for
  duplicates on receive (same message ID space as top-level Message IDs)
</ul>


<h3 id="struct_GarlicCloveDeliveryInstructions">Garlic Clove Delivery Instructions</h3>

This specification is for Delivery Instructions inside Garlic Cloves only.

Tunnel Messages,
where the format is significantly different.

Encrypted replies are only useful when the response is through a tunnel.

Encrypted:

length ::
       4 byte Integer
       number of bytes that follow 0 - 64 KB

data ::
     $length bytes
     ElGamal encrypted data


Unencrypted data:

num ::
     1 byte Integer number of `GarlicCloves` to follow

clove ::  a `GarlicClove`

Certificate :: always NULL in the current implementation (3 bytes total, all zeroes)

Message_ID :: 4 byte `Integer`

Expiration :: `Date` (8 bytes)

</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
  When unencrypted, data contains one or more <a href="#struct_GarlicClove">Garlic Cloves</a>.
<li>
  The AES encrypted block is padded to a minimum of 128 bytes; with the 32-byte Session Tag
  the minimum size of the encrypted message is 160 bytes; with the 4 length bytes
  the minimum size of the Garlic Message is 164 bytes.
<li>
  Actual max length is less than 64 KB; see the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/protocol/i2np') }}">I2NP Overview</a>.
<li>
  See also the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/elgamal-aes') }}">ElGamal/AES specification</a>.
<li>
  See also the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/how/garlic-routing') }}">garlic routing specification</a>.
<li>
  The 128 byte minimum size of the AES encrypted block is not currently configurable,
  however the minimum size of a DataMessage in a GarlicClove in a GarlicMessage, with
  overhead, is 128 bytes anyway. A configurable option to increase the minimum size
  may be added in the future.
<li>
  The message ID is generally set to a random number on transmit and
  appears to be ignored on receive.
<li>
  In the future, the certificate could possibly be used for a HashCash to "pay" for the routing.
