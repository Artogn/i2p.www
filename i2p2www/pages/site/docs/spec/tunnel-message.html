This document specifies the format of tunnel messages.
For general information about tunnels see
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/tunnels/implementation') }}">the tunnel documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Message preprocessing</h2>


A <i>tunnel gateway</i> is the entrance, or first hop, of a tunnel.
For an outbound tunnel, the gateway is the creator of the tunnel.
For an inbound tunnel, the gateway is at the opposite end from the creator of the tunnel.

<p>
A gateway <i>preprocesses</i> <a href="{{ site_url('docs/protocol/i2np') }}">I2NP messages</a>
by fragmenting and combining them into tunnel messages.

<p>
While I2NP messages are variable size from 0 to almost 64 KB,
tunnel messages are fixed-size, approximately 1 KB.
Fixed message size
restricts several types of attacks that are possible from
observing message size.

<p>
After the tunnel messages are created, they are encrypted as described in
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/tunnels/implementation') }}">the tunnel documentation</a>.

<pre>
Tunnel ID ::
       4 bytes
       the ID of the next hop

IV ::
       16 bytes
       the initialization vector

Checksum ::
       4 bytes
       the first 4 bytes of the SHA256 hash of the contents of the message after the zero byte concatenated with the IV

Nonzero padding ::
       0 or more bytes
       random nonzero data for padding

Zero ::
       1 byte
       the value 0x00

Delivery Instructions ::
       length varies but is typically 7, 39, 43, or 47 bytes
       Indicates the fragment and the routing for the fragment
       See <a href="#delivery">below</a> for specification

Message Fragment ::
       1 to 996 bytes, actual maximum depends on delivery instruction size
       A partial or full I2NP Message

total size: 1028 Bytes

</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul><li>
The padding, if any, must be before the instruction/message pairs.
There is no provision for padding at the end.
</li><li>
The checksum does NOT cover the padding or the zero byte.
</li></ul>


<h2 id="delivery">Tunnel Message Delivery Instructions</h2>

<p>The instructions are encoded with a single control byte, followed by any
necessary additional information.  The first bit (MSB) in that control byte determines
how the remainder of the header is interpreted - if it is not set, the message 
is either not fragmented or this is the first fragment in the message.  If it is
set, this is a follow on fragment.</p>

<p>
Note that "Delivery Instructions" are also used inside
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#struct_GarlicClove">Garlic Cloves</a>,
where the format is significantly different.
See the
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#struct_GarlicClove">Garlic Clove documentation</a>
for more details.
Do NOT use the following specification for Garlic Clove Delivery Instructions!


<h3>First Fragment Delivery Instructions</h3>
<p>If the MSB of the first byte is 0, this is an initial I2NP message fragment,
or a complete I2NP message, and the instructions are:</p>

                           If 1, the message is fragmented, and the instructions contain a Message ID
       bit 2: extended options?  Unimplemented, always 0
                           If 1, extended options are included
       bits 1-0: reserved, set to 0 for compatibility with future uses

       Optional, present if delivery type is TUNNEL
       The destination tunnel ID

          bits 6-0: delay exponent (2^value minutes)

Message ID:
       4 bytes
       Optional, present if this message is the first of 2 or more fragments
       An ID that uniquely identifies all fragments as belonging to a single message
       (the current implementation uses the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#struct_header">I2NP Message ID</a>)

Extended Options:
       2 or more bytes
       Optional, present if extend options flag is set
       Unimplemented, never present; original specification:
       One byte length and then that many bytes

size:
       2 bytes
       The length of the fragment that follows
       Valid values: 1 to approx. 960 in a tunnel message

       35 bytes for ROUTER / DESTINATION delivery or 39 bytes for TUNNEL delivery (unfragmented tunnel message);
       39 bytes for ROUTER delivery or 43 bytes for TUNNEL delivery (first fragment)

<h3>Follow-on Fragment Delivery Instructions</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>
{% highlight lang='dataspec' %}
frag ::
       1 byte
       binary 1nnnnnnd
              the first bit is 1 to indicate this is a follow-on fragment
              nnnnnn is the 6 bit fragment number from 1 to 63
              d is 1 to indicate the last fragment, 0 otherwise

Message ID ::
       4 bytes
       Identifies the fragment sequence that this fragment belongs to.
       This will match the message ID of an initial fragment (a fragment
       with flag bit 7 set to 0 and flag bit 3 set to 1).

size ::
       2 bytes
       the length of the fragment that follows
       valid values: 1 to 996

total length: 7 bytes

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<h3>I2NP Message Maximum Size</h3>
<p>
While the maximum I2NP message size is nominally 64 KB, the size is further constrained by the
method of fragmenting I2NP messages into multiple 1 KB tunnel messages.
The maximum number of fragments is 64, and the initial fragment may not
be perfectly aligned at the start of a tunnel message.
So the message must nominally fit in 63 fragments.
<p>
The maximum size of an initial fragment is 956 bytes (assuming TUNNEL delivery mode);
the maximum size of a follow-on fragment is 996 bytes.
Therefore the maximum size is approximately 956 + (62 * 996) = 62708 bytes, or 61.2 KB.
</p>

<h3>Ordering, Batching, Packing</h3>
Tunnel messages may be dropped or reordered.
The tunnel gateway, who creates tunnel messages, is free to implement any
batching, mixing, or reordering strategy to fragment I2NP messages and
efficiently pack fragments into tunnel messages.
In general, an optimal packing is not possible (the "packing problem").
The gateways may implement various delay and reordering strategies.

<h3>Cover Traffic</h3>
Tunnel messages may contain only padding (i.e. no delivery instructions or message fragments at all)
for cover traffic. This is unimplemented.
