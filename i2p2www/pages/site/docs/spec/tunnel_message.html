<h1>Tunnel Message Specification</h1>
This document specifies the format of tunnel messages.
For general information about tunnels see
<a href="tunnel-alt.html">the tunnel documentation</a>.

<h2>Message preprocessing</h3>


A <i>tunnel gateway</i> is the entrance, or first hop, of a tunnel.
For an outbound tunnel, the gateway is the creator of the tunnel.
For an inbound tunnel, the gateway is at the opposite end from the creator of the tunnel.

<p>
A gateway <i>preprocesses</i> <a href="i2np.html">I2NP messages</a>
by fragmenting and combining them into tunnel messages.

<p>
While I2NP messages are variable size from 0 to almost 64 KB,
tunnel messages are fixed-size, approximately 1 KB.
Fixed message size
restricts several types of attacks that are possible from
observing message size.

<p>
After the tunnel messages are created, they are encrypted as described in
<a href="tunnel-alt.html">the tunnel documentation</a>.

<h4>Definition</h4>
<pre>
Tunnel ID:
       4 bytes
       The ID of the next hop

IV:
       16 bytes
       The initialization vector

Checksum:
       4 bytes
       The first 4 bytes of the SHA256 hash of the remaining contents of the message concatenated with the IV

Nonzero padding:
       0 or more bytes
       Random nonzero data for padding

Zero:
       1 byte
       The value 0x00

Delivery Instructions:
       Length varies but is typically 7, 39, 43, or 47 bytes
       Indicates the fragment and the routing for the fragment
       See <a href="#delivery">below</a> for specification

Message Fragment:
       1 to 996 bytes, actual maximum depends on delivery instruction size
       A partial or full I2NP Message

Total Size: 1028 Bytes

</pre>


<p>Note that the padding, if any, must be before the instruction/message pairs.
there is no provision for padding at the end.</p>

<h2 id="delivery">Delivery Instructions</h2>

<p>The instructions are encoded with a single control byte, followed by any
necessary additional information.  The first bit (MSB) in that control byte determines
how the remainder of the header is interpreted - if it is not set, the message 
is either not fragmented or this is the first fragment in the message.  If it is
set, this is a follow on fragment.</p>

<p>
Note that Delivery Instructions are also used inside
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#struct_GarlicClove">Garlic Cloves</a>,
where the format is slightly different. In a Garlic Clove,
messages are not fragmented, and the fragment bit in the flag byte is
redefined. See the
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/i2np') }}#struct_GarlicClove">Garlic Clove documentation</a>
for more details.


<h3>First Fragment Delivery Instructions</h3>
<p>If the MSB of the first byte is 0, this is an initial I2NP message fragment,
or a complete I2NP message, and the instructions are:</p>

<h3><a href="http://docs.i2p-projekt.de/javadoc/net/i2p/data/i2np/DeliveryInstructions.html">Delivery Instructions Javadoc</a></h3>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<h3>I2NP Message Maximum Size</h3>
<p>
While the maximum I2NP message size is nominally 64 KB, the size is further constrained by the
method of fragmenting I2NP messages into multiple 1 KB tunnel messages.
The maximum number of fragments is 64, and the initial fragment may not
be perfectly aligned at the start of a tunnel message.
So the message must nominally fit in 63 fragments.
<p>
The maximum size of an initial fragment is 956 bytes (assuming TUNNEL delivery mode);
the maximum size of a follow-on fragment is 996 bytes.
Therefore the maximum size is approximately 956 + (62 * 996) = 62708 bytes, or 61.2 KB.
</p>

<h3>Ordering, Batching, Packing</h3>
Tunnel messages may be dropped or reordered.
The tunnel gateway, who creates tunnel messages, is free to implement any
batching, mixing, or reordering strategy to fragment I2NP messages and
efficiently pack fragments into tunnel messages.
In general, an optimal packing is not possible (the "packing problem").
The gateways may implement various delay and reordering strategies.

<h3>Cover Traffic</h3>
Tunnel messages may contain only padding (i.e. no delivery instructions or message fragments at all)
for cover traffic. This is unimplemented.
