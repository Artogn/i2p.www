<h2>Version 3 Changes</h2>
<h3>Version 3.0 Changes</h3>
<p>
Version 3.0 was introduced in I2P release 0.7.3.
SAM v2 provided a way to manage several sockets
on the same I2P destination <i>in parallel</i>, i.e. the client does not
have to wait for data being successfully sent on one socket before sending
data on another socket. But all data transited through the same
client&lt;--&gt;SAM socket, which was quite complicated to manage for the client.
<p />
SAM v3 manages sockets in a different way: each <i>I2P socket</i>
matches a unique client&lt;--&gt;SAM socket, which is much more simple to handle.
This is similar to <a href="{{ site_url('docs/api/bob') }}">BOB</a>.
<br />
SAM v3 also offers a UDP port for sending datagrams through I2P, and
can forward back I2P datagrams to the client's datagram server.
</p>

<h3>Version 3.1 Changes</h3>
<p>
Version 3.1 was introduced in I2P release 0.9.14.
<ul>
<li>DEST GENERATE and SESSION CREATE now support a SIGNATURE_TYPE parameter.
<li>The MIN and MAX parameters in HELLO VERSION are now optional.
<li>The MIN and MAX parameters in HELLO VERSION now support single-digit versions such as "3".
<li>RAW SEND is now supported on the bridge socket.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Version 3.2 Proposal</h3>
<p>
Version 3.2 is not yet implemented, and the changes listed below are preliminary.
<ul>
<li>SESSION CREATE now supports options FROM_PORT=nnnn and TO_PORT=nnnn to set default I2P ports
<li>SESSION CREATE STYLE=RAW now supports option PROTOCOL=nnn to set default I2P protocol (18 otherwise)
<li>STREAM CONNECT, DATAGRAM SEND, and RAW SEND now support new options FROM_PORT=nnnn and TO_PORT=nnnn
    to override default I2P ports for that connection
<li>STREAM ACCEPT now supports option TO_PORT=nnnn to accept connections on that I2P port only
<li>RAW SEND now supports option PROTOCOL=nnn to override default I2P RAW protocol value (18)
<li>DATAGRAM RECEIVED, RAW RECEIVED, and forwarded or received streams and datagrams, when SILENT=false,
    now appends to the first line is FROM_PORT=nnnn TO_PORT=nnnn to indicate I2P ports
<li>The first line of datagrams sent through port 7655 may now start with any 3.x version
<li>The first line of datagrams sent through port 7655 may have, after the destination,
    any of the options FROM_PORT=nnnn TO_PORT=nnnn PROTOCOL=nnn
<li>RAW RECEIVED now appends to the first line PROTOCOL=nnn to indicate I2P protocol
<li>DATAGRAM SEND and RAW SEND now supports options SEND_TAGS=nnn, TAG_THRESHOLD=nnn, EXPIRES=nnnnnnn, and SEND_LEASESET=true|false.
    These will be passed to I2CP if supported. See <a href="..//i2cp#msg_SendMessageExpire">the I2CP specification</a> for details.
    Support by the SAM server is optional, it will ignore these options if unsupported.
<li>Client and server may now send: PING [arbitrary text] on the control port,
    with the response:
    PONG [arbitrary text from the ping], to be used for control socket keepalive.
    Either side may close the session and socket if no response is received in a reasonable time, implementation dependent.
<li>For authorization, client adds USER=xxx PASSWORD=yyy to the HELLO parameters.
    On failure the server will reply with an I2P_ERROR and a message.
<li>(optional feature) Authorization configuration with the AUTH command:
  <ul>
    <li>AUTH ENABLE enables authorization on subsequent connections
    <li>AUTH DISABLE disables authorization on subsequent connections
    <li>AUTH ADD USER=foo PASSWORD=bar adds a user/password
    <li>AUTH REMOVE USER=foo removes this user
  </ul>
<li>Multiple concurrent pending STREAM ACCEPTs are allowed on the same session ID (even with the same port).
    It isn't clear (either in the spec or the code) if these are allowed now.
<li>The server's control socket may optionally offer SSL/TLS support, as configured on the server and client.
    Implementations may offer other transport layers as well; this is outside the scope of the protocol definition.
<li>For STREAM FORWARD, client may add SSL=true to use an SSL socket
<li>New commands QUIT, STOP and EXIT will close the session and socket
</ul>
</p>



<h3>Version 3.3 Proposal</h3>
<p>
Version 3.3 is not yet implemented, and the changes listed below are preliminary.
<ul>
<li>The same session ID may be used for streams, datagrams, and raw simultaneously.
    Incoming packets and streams will be routed based on I2P protocol and to-port.
</ul>
</p>



<h2>Version 3 Protocol</h2>
<h3>Simple Anonymous Messaging (SAM version 3.0) Specification Overview</h3>
<p>
Client application talks to SAM bridge, which deals with
all of the I2P functionality (using the streaming 
lib for virtual streams, or I2CP directly for async messages).

</p><p>
All client&lt;--&gt;SAM bridge communication is unencrypted and 
unauthenticated.  Access to the SAM
bridge should be protected through firewalls or other means
(perhaps the bridge may have ACLs on what IPs it accepts 
connections from).

</p><p>
All of these SAM messages are sent on a single line in plain ASCII,
terminated by the newline character (\n).  The formatting shown
below is merely for readability, and while the first two words in
each message must stay in their specific order, the ordering of
the key=value pairs can change (e.g. "ONE TWO A=B C=D" or 
"ONE TWO C=D A=B" are both perfectly valid constructions).  In
addition, the protocol is case-sensitive.
In the following, message examples are preceded by "-&gt; " for
messages sent by the client to the SAM bridge, and by "&lt;- " for
messages sent by the SAM bridge to the client.

</p><p>
SAM messages are interpreted in UTF-8. Key=value pairs must be separated by
a single space. Values may be enclosed in double quotes if they contain spaces,
e.g. key="long value text". There is no escaping mechanism.

</p><p>
I2P communications can take three distinct forms:
<ul><li>
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/api/streaming') }}">Virtual streams</a>
</lil><li>
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/datagrams') }}#repliable">Repliable datagrams</a> (messages with a FROM field)
</lil><li>
<a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/datagrams') }}#raw">Anonymous datagrams</a> (raw anonymous messages)
</lil></ul>
</p><p>
I2P communications are supported by I2P sessions, and each I2P
session is bound to an address (called destination). An I2P session
is associated with one of the three types above, and cannot carry
communications of another type.
</p>
  
<h3>SAM Connection Handshake</h3>
<p>
No SAM communication can occur until after the client and bridge have
agreed on a protocol version, which is done by the client sending
a HELLO and the bridge sending a HELLO REPLY: 
<pre>
-&gt;  HELLO VERSION MIN=$min MAX=$max
</pre>
and
<pre>
&lt;-  HELLO REPLY RESULT=OK VERSION=3.1
</pre>

</p><p>
As of version 3.1 (I2P 0.9.14), the MIN and MAX parameters are optional.
SAM will always return the highest version possible given the
MIN and MAX constraints, or 3.1 if no constraints are given.

If the SAM bridge cannot find a suitable version, it replies with :
<pre>
&lt;- HELLO REPLY RESULT=NOVERSION
</pre>
If some error occurred, such as a bad request format, it replies with :
<pre>
&lt;- HELLO REPLY RESULT=I2P_ERROR MESSAGE=$message
</pre>
</p>

<h3>SAM Sessions</h3>
<p>
A SAM session is created by a client opening a socket to the SAM 
bridge, operating a handshake, and sending a SESSION CREATE message, 
and the session terminates when the socket is disconnected.

</p><p>
Each registered I2P Destination is uniquely associated with a session ID
(or nickname).

</p><p>
Each session is uniquely associated with :
<ul><li>
the socket from which the client creates the session
</li><li>
its ID (or nickname)
</li></ul>

</p><p>
The session creation message can only use one of these forms (messages 
received through other forms are answered with an error message) :

<pre>
-&gt;  SESSION CREATE 
          STYLE={STREAM,DATAGRAM,RAW}
          ID=$nickname
          DESTINATION={$privkey,TRANSIENT}
          [option=value]*
</pre>

</p><p>
DESTINATION specifies what destination should be used for 
sending and receiving messages/streams.
The $privkey is the base 64 of the concatenation of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>
followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_PrivateKey">Private Key</a>
followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_SigningPrivateKey">Signing Private Key</a>,
which is 663 or more bytes in binary and 884 or more bytes in base 64,
depending on signature type.
The binary format is specified in <a href="http://docs.i2p-projekt.de/javadoc/net/i2p/data/PrivateKeyFile.html">Private Key File</a>.

</p><p>
If the destination is specified as TRANSIENT, the SAM bridge creates a new destination.
As of version 3.1 (I2P 0.9.14), if the destination is TRANSIENT, an optional parameter
SIGNATURE_TYPE is supported. The SIGNATURE_TYPE value may be any name
(e.g. ECDSA_SHA256_P256, case insensitive) or number (e.g. 1)
supported by <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Certificate">Key Certificates</a>.
The default is DSA_SHA1.

</p><p>
$nickname is the choice of the client. No whitespace is allowed.

</p><p>
Additional options given are passed to the I2P session 
configuration if not interpreted by the SAM bridge (e.g. 
outbound.length=0). These options <a href="#options">are documented below</a>..

</p><p>
The SAM bridge itself should already be configured with what router 
it should communicate over I2P through (though if need be there may
be a way to provide an override, e.g. i2cp.tcp.host=localhost and 
i2cp.tcp.port=7654).

</p><p>
After receiving the session create message, the SAM bridge will reply
with a session status message, as follows:

</p><p>
If the creation was successful :
<pre>
&lt;-  SESSION STATUS RESULT=OK DESTINATION=$privkey
</pre>

</p><p>
The $privkey is the base 64 of the concatenation of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>
followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_PrivateKey">Private Key</a>
followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_SigningPrivateKey">Signing Private Key</a>,
which is 663 or more bytes in binary and 884 or more bytes in base 64,
depending on signature type.
The binary format is specified in <a href="http://docs.i2p-projekt.de/javadoc/net/i2p/data/PrivateKeyFile.html">Private Key File</a>.

</p><p>
If the nickname is already associated with a session :
<pre>
&lt;-  SESSION STATUS RESULT=DUPLICATED_ID
</pre>

</p><p>
If the destination is already in use :
<pre>
&lt;-  SESSION STATUS RESULT=DUPLICATED_DEST
</pre>

</p><p>
If the destination is not a valid private destination key :
<pre>
&lt;-  SESSION STATUS RESULT=INVALID_KEY
</pre>

</p><p>
If some other error has occurred :
<pre>
&lt;-  SESSION STATUS RESULT=I2P_ERROR MESSAGE=$message
</pre>

</p><p>
If it's not OK, the MESSAGE should contain human-readable information
as to why the session could not be created.


</p><p>
SAM sessions live and die with the socket they are associated with.
When the socket is closed, the session dies, and all communications
using the session die at the same time. And the other way round, when
the session dies for any reason, the SAM bridge closes the socket.
</p>


<h3>SAM Virtual Streams</h3>
<p>
Virtual streams are guaranteed to be sent reliably and in order, with
failure and success notification as soon as it is available.

</p><p>
Streams are bidirectional communication sockets between two I2P
destinations, but their opening has to be requested by one of them. 
Hereafter, CONNECT commands are used by the SAM client for such a
request. FORWARD / ACCEPT commands are used by the SAM client when
he wants to listen to requests coming from other I2P destinations.
</p>


<h3>SAM Virtual Streams : CONNECT</h3>
<p>
A client asks for a connection by :
<ul><li>
opening a new socket with the SAM bridge
</li><li>
passing the same HELLO handshake as above
</li><li>
sending the connection command :  
</li></ul>

<pre>
-&gt; STREAM CONNECT
         ID=$nickname
         DESTINATION=$destination
         [SILENT={true,false}]
</pre>

</p><p>
This establishes a new virtual connection from the local session
whose ID is $nickname to the specified peer.

</p><p>
The target is $destination, which is the base 64 of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>,
which is 516 or more base 64 characters (387 or more bytes in binary),
depending on signature type.

</p><p>
If SILENT=true is passed, the SAM bridge won't issue any other message
on the socket : if the connection fails, the socket will be closed.
If the connection succeeds, all remaining data passing through the
current socket is forwarded from and to the connected I2P destination
peer.

</p><p>
If SILENT=false, which is the default value, the SAM bridge sends a
last message to its client before forwarding or shutting down the
socket :

<pre>
&lt;-  STREAM STATUS 
         RESULT=$result
         [MESSAGE=...]
</pre>

</p><p>
The RESULT value may be one of:

<pre>
    OK
    CANT_REACH_PEER
    I2P_ERROR
    INVALID_KEY
    INVALID_ID
    TIMEOUT
</pre>

</p><p>
If the RESULT is OK, all remaining data passing through the
current socket is forwarded from and to the connected I2P destination
peer. If the connection was not possible (timeout, etc),
RESULT will contain the appropriate error value (accompanied by an
optional human-readable MESSAGE), and the SAM bridge closes the
socket.
</p>

<h3>SAM Virtual Streams : ACCEPT</h3>
<p>
A client waits for an incoming connection request by :
<ul><li>
opening a new socket with the SAM bridge
</li><li>
passing the same HELLO handshake as above
</li><li>
sending the accept command :  
</li></ul>

<pre>
-&gt; STREAM ACCEPT
         ID=$nickname
         [SILENT={true,false}]
</pre>

</p><p>
This makes the session ${nickname} listen for one incoming
connection request from the I2P network.

</p><p>
The SAM bridge answers with :

<pre>
&lt;-  STREAM STATUS 
         RESULT=$result
         [MESSAGE=...]
</pre>

</p><p>
The RESULT value may be one of:

<pre>
    OK
    I2P_ERROR
    INVALID_ID
</pre>

</p><p>
If the result is not OK, the socket is closed immediately by the SAM
bridge. If the result is OK, the SAM bridge starts waiting for an
incoming connection request from another I2P peer. When a request
arrives, the SAM bridge accepts it and :

</p><p>
If SILENT=true was passed, the SAM bridge won't issue any other message
on the client socket : all remaining data passing through the
current socket is forwarded from and to the connected I2P destination
peer.

</p><p>
If SILENT=false was passed, which is the default value, the SAM bridge
sends the client a ASCII line containing the base64 public destination key
of the requesting peer. After this '\n' terminated line, all remaining data 
passing through the current socket is forwarded from and to the connected
I2P destination peer, until one of the peer closes the socket.
</p>

<h3>SAM Virtual Streams : FORWARD</h3>
<p>
A client can use a regular socket server and wait for connection requests
coming from I2P. For that, the client has to :
<ul><li>
open a new socket with the SAM bridge
</li><li>
pass the same HELLO handshake as above
</li><li>
send the forward command :
</ul></li>

<pre>
-&gt; STREAM FORWARD
         ID=$nickname
         PORT=$port
         [HOST=$host]
         [SILENT={true,false}]
</pre>

</p><p>
This makes the session ${nickname} listen for incoming
connection requests from the I2P network.

</p><p>
The SAM bridge answers with :

<pre>
&lt;-  STREAM STATUS 
         RESULT=$result
         [MESSAGE=...]
</pre>

</p><p>
The RESULT value may be one of:

<pre>
    OK
    I2P_ERROR
    INVALID_ID
</pre>

</p><p>
$host is the hostname or IP address of the socket server to which
SAM will forward connection requests. If not given, SAM takes the IP
of the socket that issued the forward command.

</p><p>
$port is the port number of the socket server to which SAM will
forward connection requests. It is mandatory.

</p><p>
When a connection request arrives from I2P, the SAM bridge requests a
socket connection from $host:$port. If it is accepted after no more
than 3 seconds, SAM will accept the connection from I2P, and then :

</p><p>
If SILENT=true was passed, all data passing through the obtained
current socket is forwarded from and to the connected I2P destination
peer.

</p><p>
If SILENT=false was passed, which is the default value, the SAM bridge
sends on the obtained socket an ASCII line containing the base64 public
destination key of the requesting peer. After this '\n' terminated line,
all remaining data passing through the socket is forwarded from and to 
the connected I2P destination peer, until one of the sides closes the
socket.



</p><p>
The I2P router will stop listening to incoming connection requests as
soon as the "forwarding" socket is closed.




<h3>SAM Repliable Datagrams : Sending a Datagram</h3>
<p>
While I2P doesn't inherently contain a FROM address, for ease of use
an additional layer is provided as repliable datagrams - unordered
and unreliable messages of up to 31744 bytes that include a FROM 
address (leaving up to 1KB for header material).  This FROM address 
is authenticated internally by SAM (making use of the destination's 
signing key to verify the source) and includes replay prevention.

</p><p>
Minimum size is 1. For best delivery reliability, recommended maximum
size is approximately 11 KB.

</p><p>
After establishing a SAM session with STYLE=DATAGRAM, the client can
send datagrams through SAM's UDP port (7655).

</p><p>
The first line of a datagram sent through this port has to be in the
following format :

<p>
3.0 $nickname $destination
</p>

<ul><li>
 3.0 is the version of SAM
</li><li>
 $nickname is the id of the DATAGRAM session that will be used
</li><li>
 The target is $destination, which is the base 64 of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>,
   which is 516 or more base 64 characters (387 or more bytes in binary),
   depending on signature type.
</li><li>
 this line is '\n' terminated.
</li></ul>

</p><p>
The first line will be discarded by SAM before sending the remaining
of the message to the specified destination.

</p><p>
For an alternate method of sending repliable datagrams, see <a href="#dgsend">DATAGRAM SEND</a>.
</p>

<h3>SAM Repliable Datagrams : Receiving a Datagram</h3>
<p>
Received datagrams are written by SAM on the socket from which the
datagram session was opened, unless specified otherwise by the CREATE
command.

</p><p>
When a datagram arrives, the bridge delivers it to the client via the
message :

<pre>
&lt;-  DATAGRAM RECEIVED
           DESTINATION=$destination
           SIZE=$numBytes\n[$numBytes of data]
</pre>

</p><p>
The source is $destination, which is the base 64 of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>,
which is 516 or more base 64 characters (387 or more bytes in binary),
depending on signature type.

</p><p>
The SAM bridge never exposes to the client the authentication headers
or other fields, merely the data that the sender provided.  This 
continues until the session is closed (by the client dropping the
connection).

<h3>SAM Repliable Datagrams : Forwarding Datagrams</h3>
<p>
When creating a datagram session, the client can ask SAM to forward
incoming messages to a specified ip:port. It does so by issuing the
CREATE command with PORT and HOST options :

<pre>
-&gt; SESSION CREATE 
          STYLE=DATAGRAM
          ID=$nickname
          DESTINATION={$privkey,TRANSIENT}
          PORT=$port
          [HOST=$host]
          [option=value]*
</pre>

</p><p>
 The $privkey is the base 64 of the concatenation of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>
   followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_PrivateKey">Private Key</a>
   followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_SigningPrivateKey">Signing Private Key</a>,
   which is 884 or more base 64 characters (663 or more bytes in binary),
   depending on signature type.
   The binary format is specified in <a href="http://docs.i2p-projekt.de/javadoc/net/i2p/data/PrivateKeyFile.html">Private Key File</a>.

</p><p>
 $host is the hostname or IP address of the datagram server to
     which SAM will forward datagrams. If not given, SAM takes the
     IP of the socket that issued the forward command.

</p><p>
 $port is the port number of the datagram server to which SAM
     will forward datagrams.

</p><p>
Additional options given are passed to the I2P session 
configuration if not interpreted by the SAM bridge (e.g. 
outbound.length=0). These options <a href="#options">are documented below</a>..

</p><p>
Forwarded datagrams are always prefixed with the destination
(SILENT=false); SILENT=true is not honored.
When a datagram arrives, the bridge sends to the specified host:port
a UDP packet containing the following data :

<pre>
$destination\n$datagram_payload
</pre>

</p><p>
The $destination is the base 64 of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>,
which is 516 or more base 64 characters (387 or more bytes in binary),
depending on signature type.
</p>


<h3>SAM Anonymous Datagrams</h3>
<p>
Squeezing the most out of I2P's bandwidth, SAM allows clients to send
and receive anonymous datagrams, leaving authentication and reply 
information up to the client themselves.  These datagrams are 
unreliable and unordered, and may be up to 32768 bytes.

</p><p>
Minimum size is 1. For best delivery reliability, recommended maximum
size is approximately 11 KB.

</p><p>
After establishing a SAM session with STYLE=RAW, the client can
send anonymous datagrams through the SAM bridge exactly the same way
he sends non anonymous datagrams.

</p><p>
Both ways of receiving datagrams are also available for anonymous
datagrams.

</p><p>
When anonymous datagrams are to be written to the socket that created
the session,the bridge delivers it to the client via:

<pre>
&lt;- RAW RECEIVED
      SIZE=$numBytes\n[$numBytes of data]
</pre>

</p><p>
When anonymous datagrams are to be forwarded to some host:port,
the bridge sends to the specified host:port a message containing 
the following data :

<pre>
$datagram_payload
</pre>

</p><p>
For an alternate method of sending anonymous datagrams, see <a href="#dgsend">RAW SEND</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="dgsend">DATAGRAM SEND, RAW SEND (V1/V2 Compatible Datagram Handling)</h3>
<p>
In SAM V3, the preferred way to send datagrams is via the datagram socket
at port 7655 as documented above. However, repliable datagrams may be sent
directly via the SAM bridge socket using the DATAGRAM SEND command,
as documented in <a href="sam">SAM V1</a> and <a href="samv2">SAM V2</a>.

</p><p>
As of release 0.9.14 (version 3.1), anonymous datagrams may be sent
directly via the SAM bridge socket using the RAW SEND command,
as documented in <a href="sam">SAM V1</a> and <a href="samv2">SAM V2</a>.

</p><p>
These commands do <i>not</i> support the ID parameter. The datagrams are
sent to the most recently created DATAGRAM- or RAW-style session,
as appropriate. Support for the ID parameter may be added in a future release.



<h3>SAM Utility Commands</h3>
<p>
The following message can be used by the client to query the SAM
bridge for name resolution:

<pre>
 NAMING LOOKUP 
        NAME=$name
</pre>

</p><p>
which is answered by

<pre>
 NAMING REPLY 
        RESULT=$result
        NAME=$name 
        [VALUE=$destination]
        [MESSAGE=$message]
</pre>


</p><p>
The RESULT value may be one of:

<pre>
    OK
    INVALID_KEY
    KEY_NOT_FOUND
</pre>

</p><p>
If NAME=ME, then the reply will contain the destination used by the
current session (useful if you're using a TRANSIENT one).  If $result
is not OK, MESSAGE may convey a descriptive message, such as "bad
format", etc.

</p><p>
The $destination is the base 64 of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>,
which is 516 or more base 64 characters (387 or more bytes in binary),
depending on signature type.


</p><p>
Public and private base64 keys can be generated using the following
message:

<pre>
 DEST GENERATE
</pre>

</p><p>
which is answered by

<pre>
 DEST REPLY
      PUB=$destination
      PRIV=$privkey
</pre>

</p><p>
As of I2P 0.9.14, an optional parameter SIGNATURE_TYPE is supported.
The SIGNATURE_TYPE value may be any name (e.g. ECDSA_SHA256_P256, case insensitive) or number (e.g. 1)
that is supported by <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Certificate">Key Certificates</a>.
The default is DSA_SHA1.

</p><p>
The $destination is the base 64 of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>,
which is 516 or more base 64 characters (387 or more bytes in binary),
depending on signature type.

</p><p>
The $privkey is the base 64 of the concatenation of the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Destination">Destination</a>
followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_PrivateKey">Private Key</a>
followed by the <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_SigningPrivateKey">Signing Private Key</a>,
which is 884 or more base 64 characters (663 or more bytes in binary),
depending on signature type.
The binary format is specified in <a href="http://docs.i2p-projekt.de/javadoc/net/i2p/data/PrivateKeyFile.html">Private Key File</a>.

<h3>RESULT Values</h3>
<p>
These are the values that can be carried by the RESULT field, with
their meaning:

<pre>
 OK              Operation completed successfully
 CANT_REACH_PEER The peer exists, but cannot be reached
 DUPLICATED_DEST The specified Destination is already in use
 I2P_ERROR       A generic I2P error (e.g. I2CP disconnection, etc.)
 INVALID_KEY     The specified key is not valid (bad format, etc.)
 KEY_NOT_FOUND   The naming system can't resolve the given name
 PEER_NOT_FOUND  The peer cannot be found on the network
 TIMEOUT         Timeout while waiting for an event (e.g. peer answer)
</pre>


<h3 id="options">Tunnel, I2CP, and Streaming Options</h3>
<p>
These options may be passed in as name=value pairs at the end of a
SAM SESSION CREATE line.

</p><p>
All sessions may include <a href="{{ site_url('docs/protocol/i2cp') }}#options">I2CP options such as tunnel lengths</a>.
STREAM sessions may include <a href="{{ site_url('docs/api/streaming') }}#options">Streaming lib options</a>.
See those references for option names and defaults.


<h3>BASE 64 Notes</h3>

<p>
Base 64 encoding must use the I2P standard Base 64 alphabet "A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, ~".
</p>

<h3>Client Library Implementations</h3>
<p>
Client libraries are available for C, C++, C#, Perl, and Python.
These are in the apps/sam/ directory in the <a href="{{ get_url('downloads_list') }}">I2P Source Package</a>.
Some may be older and have not been updated for SAMv3 support.
</p>

<h3>Default SAM Setup</h3>
<p>
The default SAM port is 7656. SAM is not enabled by default in the I2P Router;
it must be started manually, or configured to start automatically,
on the configure clients page in the router console, or in the clients.config file.
The default SAM UDP port is 7655, listening on 0.0.0.0.
These may be changed by adding the arguments sam.udp.port=nnnnn and/or
sam.udp.host=w.x.y.z to the invocation.
