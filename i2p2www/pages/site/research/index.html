<p>
Academic research and analysis of I2P is an important part of ensuring that the software and network performs as expected and is safe for users in hostile environments.
</p>

<p>
I2P can be run as a separate test network by controlling the locations that a new router reseeds from so that it only finds other test routers. Additionally, the router can be run on its own in a virtual network mode to enable testing the router in isolation; to enable this mode, add <code>i2p.vmCommSystem=true</code> to the router.config before starting.
</p>

<p>
If you are planning on conducting research on the live I2P network, please <a href="{{ site_url('about/contact') }}">contact us</a> before you commence your testing. While we do not discourage researchers from responsibly testing their ideas on the live network, if an attack becomes apparent and we don't have any line of communication then we will end up taking countermeasures which could interfere with the test.
