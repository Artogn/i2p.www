<h3>{{ _('Unidirectional tunnels') }}</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the benefits of unidirectional tunnels over bidirectional tunnels? What are the tradeoffs?</li>
<li>More details are available <a href="{{ site_url('docs/tunnels/unidirectional') }}">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>{{ _('Multihoming') }}</h3>
<ul>
<li>How effective is multihoming at load-balancing?</li>
<li>How does it scale? What happens as more routers host the same Destination?</li>
<li>The benefit for anonymity is less correlation of router uptime to Destination uptime. Are there tradeoffs?</li>
</ul>

<h3>{{ _('Message routing') }}</h3>
<ul>
<li>How much is the effectiveness of timing attacks reduced by fragmentation and mixing of messages?</li>
<li>What mixing strategies could I2P benefit from?</li>
<li>How can high-latency techniques (e.g. message-dependent routing delays) be effectively employed within or alongside our low-latency network?</li>
</ul>
