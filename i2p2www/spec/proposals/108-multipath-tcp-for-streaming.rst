Introduction
============

Client tunnels are used by the streaming lib in a fairly standard TCP manner.

It would be preferable to allow a multipath TCP-like solution, where client
tunnels are used based on individual characteristics like:

- Latency
- Capacity
- Availability


Proposal
========

TBD
