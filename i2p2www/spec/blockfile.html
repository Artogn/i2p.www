<h3>{% trans %}Overview{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans naming=site_url('docs/naming') -%} 
This document specifies
the I2P blockfile file format
and the tables in the hostsdb.blockfile used by the Blockfile <a href="{{ naming }}">Naming Service</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The blockfile provides fast Destination lookup in a compact format. While the blockfile page overhead is substantial,
the destinations are stored in binary rather than in Base 64 as in the hosts.txt format.
In addition, the blockfile provides the capability of arbitrary metadata storage
(such as added date, source, and comments) for each entry.
The metadata may be used in the future to provide advanced addressbook features.
The blockfile storage requirement is a modest increase over the hosts.txt format, and the blockfile provides
approximately 10x reduction in lookup times.

<p>{% trans url='http://www.metanotion.net/software/sandbox/block.html' -%}
A blockfile is simply on-disk storage of multiple sorted maps (key-value pairs),
implemented as skiplists.
The blockfile format is adopted from the
<a href="{{ url }}">Metanotion Blockfile Database</a>.
First we will define the file format, then the use of that format by the BlockfileNamingService.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans %}Blockfile Format{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The original blockfile spec was modified to add magic numbers to each page.
The file is structured in 1024-byte pages. Pages are numbered starting from 1.
The "superblock" is always at page 1, i.e. starting at byte 0 in the file.
The metaindex skiplist is always at page 2, i.e. starting at byte 1024 in the file.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
All 2-byte integer values are unsigned.
All 4-byte integer values (page numbers) are signed and negative values are illegal.
All integer values are stored in network byte order (big endian).
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
The database is designed to be opened and accessed by a single thread.
The BlockfileNamingService provides synchronization.

<p>{% trans -%}
Skip level block page format is as follows.
All levels have a span. Not all spans have levels.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans -%}
Skip span block page format is as follows.
Key/value structures are sorted by key within each span and across all spans.
Key/value structures are sorted by key within each span.
Spans other than the first span may not be empty.

<p>{% trans -%}
Key/value structure format is as follows.
Key and value lengths must not be split across pages, i.e. all 4 bytes must be on the same page.
If there is not enough room the last 1-3 bytes of a page are unused and the lengths will
be at offset 8 in the continuation page.
Key and value data may be split across pages.
Max key and value lengths are 65535 bytes.

The metaindex (located at page 2) is a mapping of US-ASCII strings to 4-byte integers.
The key is the name of the skiplist and the value is the page index of the skiplist.

<h3>{% trans %}Blockfile Naming Service Tables{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>{% trans -%}
The tables created and used by the BlockfileNamingService are as follows.
The maximum number of entries per span is 16.
{%- endtrans %}</p>

<h4>{% trans %}Properties Skiplist{% endtrans %}</h4>
<p>{% trans INFO='"%%__INFO__%%"' -%}
{{ INFO }} is the master database skiplist with String/Properties key/value entries containing only one entry:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<pre>
    "info": a Properties (UTF-8 String/String Map), serialized as a <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Mapping">Mapping</a>:
            "version":   "3"
            "created":   Java long time (ms)
            "upgraded":  Java long time (ms) (as of database version 2)
            "lists":     Comma-separated list of host databases, to be
                         searched in-order for lookups. Almost always "privatehosts.txt,userhosts.txt,hosts.txt".
</pre>

<h4>{% trans %}Reverse Lookup Skiplist{% endtrans %}</h4>
<p>{% trans REVERSE='"%%__REVERSE__%%"' -%}
{{ REVERSE }} is the reverse lookup skiplist with Integer/Properties key/value entries
    (as of database version 2):
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<pre>
    The skiplist keys are 4-byte Integers, the first 4 bytes of the hash of the Destination.
    The skiplist values are each a Properties (a UTF-8 String/String Map) serialized as a <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Mapping">Mapping</a>
        There may be multiple entries in the properties, each one is a reverse mapping,
           as there may be more than one hostname for a given destination,
           or there could be collisions with the same first 4 bytes of the hash.
        Each property key is a hostname.
        Each property value is the empty string.
</pre>

<h4>{% trans %}hosts.txt, userhosts.txt, and privatehosts.txt Skiplists{% endtrans %}</h4>
<p>{% trans -%}
For each host database, there is a skiplist containing
the hosts for that database.
The keys/values in these skiplists are as follows:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<pre>
     key:    a UTF-8 String (the hostname)
     value:  a DestEntry, which is a Properties (a UTF-8 String/String Map) serialized as a <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#type_Mapping">Mapping</a>
             followed by a binary Destination (serialized <a href="{{ site_url('docs/spec/common-structures') }}#struct_Destination">as usual</a>).
</pre>

<p>{% trans -%}
The DestEntry Properties typically contains:
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<pre>
            "a":     The time added (Java long time in ms)
            "s":     The original source of the entry (typically a file name or subscription URL)
            others:  TBD
</pre>

<p>{% trans -%}
Hostname keys are stored in lower-case and always end in ".i2p".
{%- endtrans %}</p>
