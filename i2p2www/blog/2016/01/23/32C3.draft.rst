Start
=====
Wooo! Another successful year at CCC.
A huge shoutout to the angels and organizers at `32C3`_.
Just like previous years, we were located in Noisy Square to the right of the EFF's table.
Many were able to attend due to the generous donations.
As always, there was a lot of interest in I2P, and we were able to talk to many people who we otherwise would not have had the ability to.

The Year of Usability!
======================
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
There was a lot of talk about the usability of the router console.
Many people noted that their best experience with I2P was through Vuze/I2PBote-Android.
Currently there are vague discussions of redoing the current router console since it is a bit abrasive for new users to understand.

We need your feedback!
Even if you don't use I2P often, we want to know what you think.
There are lots of ways to contact us, Twitter, or email.
See the `contacts page`_.

Reseed Status
=============
{%- endtrans %}

Let's get more reseeds!
There was a lot of discussion around the current status of the reseed network right now.
As always, more reseed operators are needed!
If you don't know, a reseed server is the server new routers contact to find peers.
If you have the resources to run a reseed, (or if you're talented in Go) email backup -at- i2pmail.i2p.

Sybil Detection (beta)
======================
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
Due to the decentralized nature of I2P, detecting Sybil attacks is not as straight forward as on other networks (i.e. tor).
To Mitigate this, zzz has been working on a new router-based Sybil detection tool.
To be brief, the tool runs in the router, and collects information on floodfills your router is using.
Right now, the tool is mainly collecting a baseline, and does not act on any of the information it is collecting.
Expect to see a writeup on this more as 0.9.25 or 0.9.26 approaches, as it is still in active development!

Development Meeting
===================
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans -%}
On the 30th we held an in person `meeting`_ at our table.
The meeting focused on organizationally preparing for more project management, and public relations (both from Sadie).
{%- endtrans %}

.. _{% trans %}`meeting`{% endtrans %}: {{ site_url() }}meetings/241

{% trans -%}
We discussed how much of the awesome work done on I2P is lost in the commits.
Meaning that to non-developers, there is nothing to see.
To remedy this lazygravy plans on preparing a series of technical posts explaining some technical topics in I2P.
For example, but not limited to, encrypted lease sets, why different tunnel types are needed, some observations seen in [i2spy](GITHUB LINK).
