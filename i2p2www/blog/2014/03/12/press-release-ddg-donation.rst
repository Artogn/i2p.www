**Somewhere, NH** -- Internet search company `DuckDuckGo`_ `donates`_
$5000 to the `Invisible Internet Project`_ (I2P) as part of their yearly open-source
donation program. The award was granted on the basis of `nominations`_ by members of the public
on the DuckDuckGo community portal. With an emphasis on privacy, DuckDuckGo provides a search
engine which does not track its users or store personal data. I2P is an anonymous network intended to
protect individuals from dragnet surveillance regularly performed by ISPs and governments.

This marks the single largest donation ever received by I2P and reflects a growing interest in
privacy and security by the Internet community. The funding will help I2P to reach more users, expand
development, and audit the code. It will also enable I2P developers to attend conferences, such
as the `Real-World Cryptography`_ conference in New York City, where the developers met and
collaborated with cryptography experts pursuant to I2P's goals of providing anonymity to the
public.

and the I2P community for its support in the `nominations`_.
