   :excerpt: I2P Android and Bote have been released on Google Play in Norway, as a test run for a future worldwide release.

{% trans -%}
I2P Android has existed for over three years. In that time, it has evolved from 
a simple test project into a usable, useful Android port of the I2P router. Our 
eventual goal has been to release I2P Android on Google Play, to make it easier 
for users to discover, install and use I2P on their Android devices. After much 
work improving the user interface, fixing bugs and testing, we think that I2P 
Android is finally ready to go where the users are.

Also please note that we have upgraded the Android API to 9, this means that 
Froyo Android 2.2 will not be supported anymore, and the lowest requirement is 
now Gingerbread Android 2.3.

Initially, we are only releasing to Android users in Norway, as a test run.
A timely response to PST's suggestions to mass surveillance of the Norwegian people. 
Mass surveillance is about limiting our freedom, never has our own privacy been
more at stake. This won't benefit the people, and is not the solution.

I2P Android will have far more exposure on Google Play than it has ever had before, 
and there will be bugs and usability issues that we need to fix. It will be much 
easier (and less stressful!) to respond to feedback if we only need to deal with 
reports from hundreds of users instead of thousands (already orders of magnitude 
more feedback than we have ever had).

Simultaneously we are making the first public release of Bote, an Android port 
of I2P-Bote. Bote is private, distributed, secure email, made easy. It runs on 
top of the I2P network, and while it works as a standalone app, it will use the 
I2P Android app by default if installed. As with I2P Android, we are initially 
only releasing Bote to Android users in Norway.

As lead developer for I2P Android and Bote, str4d look forward to your comments. You 
are the people who will be using them, and your perspectives will help me craft 
simple, intuitive apps that make privacy accessible to everyone. 

We advice people from Norway to visit https://blog.privacysolutions.no for more information 
about the Goole Play release and download links.
