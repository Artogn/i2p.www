<pre>
[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; agenda 
[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 0) welcome 
[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1) 0.2 status 
[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 2) www proxy 
[23:01] * dm ponders.
[23:02] &lt;dm&gt; oh, meeting?
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 3) phttprelay 
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 4) i2ptunnel 
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 5) installation 
[23:02] &lt;dm&gt; sorry.
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 6) iip feature request 
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 7) ??? 
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 0) welcome  
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hi. 
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; meeting 62? is it? 
[23:02] &lt;Dellammo&gt; hi
[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (no worry dm, we can forgive you) 
[23:02] &lt;mihi&gt; hi jrand0m
[23:02] &lt;dm&gt; hi mihi
[23:02] * mihi thinks so
[23:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1) 0.2 status 
[23:03] * jrand0m has had a severe case of feature-creep-itis as of late, so the 0.2 release still has about 30 minutes left of code left to do.
[23:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but then we'll be able to run and communicate reliably regardless of NAT, firewall, or HTTP proxy. 
[23:04] * dm has just created I2PSecureRemoteShell 1.0
[23:04] &lt;dm&gt; cool jr!
[23:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; everything is functional, the only thing left to do is to expire unused database entries after N minutes (probably 5 for a default) 
[23:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the comm across NAT/firewall/HTTP proxy is the PHTTP transport.  its slow, but reliable. 
[23:05] &lt;dm&gt; how does it work? what ports does it use?
[23:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; it sends the message to a reachable PHTTP relay, which stores the message, and then the receiver polls for messages ever N seconds 
[23:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there is a LOT that can be tuned and improved on that side of things, which is agenda point 3 :) 
[23:06] &lt;dm&gt; P stands for?
[23:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; Polling HTTP 
[23:06] &lt;dm&gt; ok thanks.
[23:07] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'm going to update the "kludges" page on the wiki after the meeting too, to note the things that are funky 
[23:07] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (such as not yet handling a lease change during communication) 
[23:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the other point to discuss is agenda item 5 - installation.  aka how we should handle installation of the router/sdk/tunnel/etc 
[23:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, thats it for 0.2 status 
[23:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 2) www proxy. 
[23:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; moi had a really cool idea for browsing in-i2p www sites. 
[23:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; wanna explain whats up moi? 
[23:09] * jrand0m puts the spotlight on ya
*** moi is ~someone@anon.iip (someone) 
*** on channels: #freenet #anonymous #iip #iip-dev 
*** on irc via server anon.iip (Official IIP )
*** moi has been idle 9 minutes, signed on at Thu Jan 01 01:00:00 1970 
[23:10] &lt;moi&gt; well
[23:10] &lt;moi&gt; i am just modifying an HTTP proxy and using mihi's tunnel
[23:10] &lt;moi&gt; so that you can go to (Link: http://i2p/BASE64KEYHERE)http://i2p/BASE64KEYHERE
[23:10] &lt;moi&gt; eventually the naming server would be there--
[23:11] &lt;dm&gt; sweet
[23:11] *** Signoff: mihi (Ping timeout)
[23:11] &lt;moi&gt; you have to paste in the first long key, but after that you should technically be able to follow links I think
[23:11] &lt;Dellammo&gt; so an internal web page or a page outside of i2p?
[23:11] &lt;dm&gt; i2p resolves to localhost?
[23:11] &lt;moi&gt; so someone could put up an i2p Google, and go from there.... mabye
[23:12] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; !thwap dm.
[23:12] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; a proxy...
[23:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; for security, the proxy should 404 all hosts other than (Link: http://i2p/)http://i2p/ 
[23:12] &lt;dm&gt; oops!
[23:12] &lt;moi&gt; good point
[23:12] &lt;dm&gt; missed that part
[23:12] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; although a simple servlet would be nice too
[23:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm? 
[23:13] *** mihi (~mihi@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev
[23:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm, there may be a problem. 
[23:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; this would use HTTP 1.0 or 1.1? 
[23:14] &lt;mihi&gt; if the server requests a Host: header?
[23:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; [aka, would it have a Host: header?] 
[23:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; exactly 
[23:14] * mihi wishes for something
[23:14] &lt;moi&gt; I wonder if we can have the proxy blank that out
[23:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; if the server's outbound tunnel is always on the same host, thats fine 
[23:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; you can set the proxy Host: to 127.0.0.1 
[23:15] *** dm_backup (~as@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev
[23:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but then you must run the tunnel on the same host as the server.  not a bad problem, as its not for general normal-web browsing 
[23:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right? 
[23:15] *** Signoff: dm (Ping timeout)
[23:16] * moi hadn't thought that deeply into it yet
[23:16] &lt;mihi&gt; if you run the server on your own box you can also alias i2p to localhost or sth like that.
[23:16] &lt;dm_backup&gt; so do people have to run web servers now?
[23:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; dm_backup&gt; this is only for people who want to. 
[23:16] *** dm_backup is now known as dm
[23:16] &lt;Dellammo&gt; like me
[23:16] &lt;dm&gt; yeah, I mean for this (Link: http://i2p)http://i2p thingie
[23:17] &lt;mihi&gt; if you want to provide content, yes.
[23:17] &lt;mihi&gt; but you have to run one to provide content in good ol' www as well.
[23:18] &lt;Dellammo&gt; why?
[23:18] &lt;dm&gt; Hmmm, maybe I should build a P2P app for I2P.
[23:18] &lt;jrand0m&gt; a filesharing app over i2p would rule. 
[23:18] &lt;dm&gt; yes sorry, filesharing.
[23:19] &lt;moi&gt; I think it would be possible for someone to run an OpenNap server in conjunction with i2ptunnel
[23:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yes. 
[23:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (though a native i2p p2p would have better performance) 
[23:19] &lt;mihi&gt; but the downloads will be hard. 
[23:20] &lt;mihi&gt; no way to get to the correct host as all are localhost ;)
[23:20] &lt;dm&gt; Let's wait till we see PING running over i2ptunnel first.
[23:20] * Dellammo is confused are we talking about a proxy thats not i2ptunnel that lets you access webservers that are internal to the i2p network by typing '(Link: http://i2p/')http://i2p/' ?
[23:20] &lt;jrand0m&gt; perhaps just a simple FTP client designed to run over i2p? 
[23:20] &lt;dm&gt; (not ping literally)
[23:20] &lt;mihi&gt; jrand0m: ftp needs 2 ports...
[23:20] &lt;jrand0m&gt; designed to run over i2p. 
[23:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; a general file transfer app, not the FTP protocol, specifically 
[23:21] &lt;mihi&gt; then it's not ftp.
[23:21] &lt;mihi&gt; ATalk ;)
[23:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (taking advantage of larger message sizes) 
[23:21] &lt;dm&gt; battle of the wise men!
[23:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh 
[23:21] &lt;moi&gt; Dellammo: right now you have to create an i2ptunnel for each website/Destination you want to browse. We are thinking of using a proxy server that would dynamically build an i2ptunnel for each site.
[23:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (kind of) 
[23:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; you won't want to use an i2ptunnel, specifically.  
[23:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; you'll want to use the i2ptunnel protocol, and send messages directly, not via TCP/IP sockets. 
[23:23] &lt;jrand0m&gt; mihi&gt; any idea what kind of time it would take to factor the protocol functionality out of i2ptunnel so other apps could send data to an i2p tunnel? 
*** mihi is mihi@anon.iip (mihi) 
*** on channels: #iip-dev #iip #headlines #german #freenet-opn #freenet #fredisdead #frazaa @#fiw #anonymous

[23:25] &lt;mihi&gt; is there any large protocol functionality? I2PTunnelRunner can be used as is.
[23:25] &lt;mihi&gt; You just have to adjust the client class for your needs.
[23:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm, not really - i2ptunnelRunner uses a socket 
[23:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; this is a plain java app that wants to generate a message ("HTTP GET /\n\n") and send it to an outbound I2PTunnel 
[23:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we don't want to redirect the client contacting the proxy to a new port to connect to the newly instantiated I2PTunnel (as there'd be no way to switch back for links off that site) 
[23:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but perhaps switching I2PTunnelRunner to use an InputStream (all it uses is socket.getInputStream) would be easy... 
[23:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but then we still need the listen side 
[23:28] *** Signoff: mihi (Ping timeout)
[23:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; d'oh 
[23:28] * jrand0m hopes the backup isn't about to ping out...
[23:28] &lt;dm&gt; backup's gonna die as well ,watch it!
[23:29] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; ;)
[23:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; w00t 
[23:29] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; [23:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm, not really - i2ptunnelRunner uses a socket
[23:29] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; [23:25] &lt;mihi&gt; oops, right. and you want to do it completely without sockets?
[23:29] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; [23:26] &lt;mihi&gt; then there is not much code left from i2ptunnel. most is for handling the sockets.
[23:29] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; [23:26] &lt;mihi&gt; best stick to the protocol and implement it yourself (build the messages w/ the static method in i2ptunnel.java)
[23:29] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; [23:28] &lt;mihi&gt; http would not need that many threads. Just run a reader over the incoming message until a double return and then send your thing out.
[23:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ah 'k.  thanks 
[23:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; moi&gt; tu sabes? 
[23:30] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; re switching I2PTunnel for an input stream. what for? you won't get anythin on it any more after you parsed the request.
[23:31] * moi thinks
[23:31] &lt;dm&gt; toi thinks
[23:31] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; just forget the tunnelrunner. ;)
[23:31] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right, I was just thinking to keep the I2PTunnel and the http proxy to use the same code - I2PTunnel would use socket.getInputStream(), the http proxy would use new ByteArrayInputStream("GET / \n\n".getBytes()) 
[23:31] *** mihi (mihi@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev
[23:32] * moi will need to go over this later in detail
[23:32] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; but that will cause the runner to send a "Connection closed" when the string is sent.
[23:32] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; as the stream ends.
[23:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right, which is normal HTTP 
[23:33] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; just forget the runner, i said ;)
[23:33] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 'k 
[23:33] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; jrand0m: nope. the connection is closed when the answer is here, not when the question is out.
[23:33] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh yeah 
[23:33] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ;) 
[23:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; cool moi, we can work through this stuff later on. 
[23:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, thats agenda item 2).  now for 3) 
[23:36] &lt;moi&gt; ok
[23:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 3) phttprelay 
[23:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; phttp relay is a set of servlets wrapped in a .war file 
[23:38] &lt;jrand0m&gt; it works out of the box on windows / sun JVM, but I had to hack jetty to run w/ kaffe 
[23:38] &lt;mihi&gt; make .peace not .war
[23:39] * jrand0m groans
[23:39] &lt;dm&gt; you can run .war files without a J2ee server?
[23:39] &lt;dm&gt; good to know.
[23:39] &lt;jrand0m&gt; .war files run in any servlet container - tomcat, apache w/ mod_jk, jetty, etc 
[23:40] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we're going to want some people to run these on machines w/ publicly reachable IP addresses, but they're only necessary for people who don't have publicly reachable addresses (like me) 
[23:41] &lt;mihi&gt; which ports do you need to redirect if you want to go through a nat without that?
[23:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; its implementation is very rudimentary as well - it needs some limits as to how many routers it relays for, how many messages it queues up, how long before it times out, etc 
[23:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; just the I2NP TCP port 
[23:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (or the I2NP UDP port) 
[23:41] * mihi does not know if his nat allows udp forwarding
[23:42] * jrand0m doesn't know if mihi's nat does either
[23:43] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right now, for example, my laptop is reachable via PHTTP only, and my server's router is reachable via PHTTP, TCP, and UDP.  if my laptop establishes a connection to the server's router via TCP, it can send messages via TCP.  but if my laptop doesn't first do that, the server must send messages via PHTTP 
[23:44] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the code is in i2p/code/apps/phttprelay/ for anyone with servlets experience who wants to hack on a small app 
[23:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (it should also work transparently with https as well as plain http) 
[23:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I'll doc up the PHTTP protocol Real Soon Now.  :) 
[23:45] *** Signoff: mihi (Ping timeout)
[23:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, thats it for item 3) phttprelay 
[23:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 4) i2ptunnel 
[23:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we've already discussed a bunch of stuff.  unless mihi (or anyone else) has anything else on it, we can move to 5) 
[23:46] *** wilde (~anon@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev
[23:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hola wilde 
[23:47] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok.  that said, item 5 :) 
[23:47] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 5) installation 
[23:48] &lt;jrand0m&gt; to get 0.2 out the door, and beyond, I'm thinking of some ant scripts. 
[23:48] &lt;jrand0m&gt; or should we use another open source installation system? 
[23:48] &lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone have any experiences / thoughts on this? 
[23:49] &lt;Dellammo&gt; hmm
[23:50] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ant has the benefit of being unified with the build system, platform independent, and has headless operation. 
[23:50] &lt;wilde&gt; hey
[23:50] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but it requires ant (which requires java).  and it doesn't have a GUI 
[23:51] &lt;Dellammo&gt; i can think of many install programs for windows... i dont know how many are gpl though
[23:51] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, I have a licensed InstallAnywhere Enterprise installation, but its bad for open source 
[23:51] &lt;jrand0m&gt; NSIS is open source, but has its nuances. 
[23:51] &lt;dm&gt; stupid question: is ant included in java?
[23:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; nope. 
[23:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh, though we COULD distribute a GCJ'ed ant 
[23:52] &lt;dm&gt; alright, must have come with eclipse then.
[23:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (compiled to native code) 
[23:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; definitely dm. 
[23:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; apache makes ant (ant.apache.org) and its apache licensed. 
[23:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh, yuck. 
[23:52] * jrand0m just read the sentence I typed)
[23:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; gpl is not apl friendly, according to the FSF 
[23:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we probably can't distribute ant. 
[23:53] &lt;dm&gt; can't we just a script? what needs to be done for it to be installed?
[23:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but we can use it. 
[23:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; not much at all.  a script is fine. 
[23:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but do we want a .bat and a .sh, etc. 
[23:54] *** shardy (~shardy@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev
[23:54] &lt;dm&gt; what does an installation entail, a couple of questions?
[23:54] &lt;jrand0m&gt; writing a java installer to do the install platform independent is overkill, so we should ideally use an existing install framework 
[23:54] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, a few questions 
[23:54] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the installation targets I forsee: 
[23:54] &lt;Dellammo&gt; do we get a flashy new logo? whos working on that?
[23:54] &lt;jrand0m&gt; install-router 
[23:55] &lt;jrand0m&gt; install-www-tunnel, install-www-proxy, install-sdk, install-cvs-tunnel, update-seednodes 
[23:55] &lt;moi&gt; why not use InstallAnywhere? if the code is open that is what matters
[23:55] * jrand0m thinks YOU are Dellammo :)
[23:55] &lt;jrand0m&gt; InstallAnywhere isn't open source. 
[23:55] * Dellammo gets to work
[23:56] &lt;dm&gt; script would probably be enough at this point, but I guess might as well think ahead.
[23:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (its about 4k euro / seat) 
[23:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right.  so for tomorrow, I'll probably just write ant scripts, but we need to look into a system 
[23:56] *** Signoff: wilde (Ping timeout)
[23:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so if anyone can help out with that, it'd be appreciated :) 
[23:57] &lt;dm&gt; ah okay, I was thinking shell scripts.
[23:57] &lt;moi&gt; Some of the package managers could do that on the Linux installs
[23:57] *** wilde (~anon@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev
[23:57] &lt;jrand0m&gt; managing different installers for different platforms is a PITA 
[23:59] &lt;dm&gt; java installer? Why is it a PITA?
[23:59] &lt;jrand0m&gt; a java installer would be great 
[23:59] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; pain in the a**e
[23:59] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; oops, sorry...

[00:00] &lt;jrand0m&gt; writing a custom installer in java is possible, but its preferred to use an existing framework.  but if you're volunteering to write a custom installer, I'm behind ya! 
[00:00] &lt;dm&gt; mihi's having an epileptic seizure.
[00:00] * mihi-backup slaps dm around a bit with a large trout
[00:00] &lt;dm&gt; Tell you what...
[00:01] &lt;dm&gt; If you have time at any point to write out the exact steps needed in an install, I'll write a java installer.
[00:01] &lt;mihi-backup&gt; dm: read the ant script ;)
[00:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; word dm.  once I get the ant thing working I'll doc 'er up for you 
[00:01] &lt;dm&gt; fair enough, we'll see if I can figure out the ant script once it's out.
