<p>While we always gratefully accept any contributions of code, 
documentation, and the like, there are other ways to help I2P move 
forward.  As with any open source project, our goals would be achieved more 
rapidly if we were able to support all of our contributors to work on 
I2P full time.  However, as with any open source project, thats not a 
possibility.  Instead, we are making use of a bounty system, whereby 
anyone can get support for working on something that people want 
implemented, and people who want to contribute to I2P can be assured that 
their support goes to what they care about.</p>

<p>We are also keeping open the ability for people who want to support I2P 
but don't have strong feelings about the bounties available.  Those people
can simply put their trust in the I2P team to do what we feel is best by
donating to a catch-all general fund that will be used as deemed 
necessary - allocated to various bounties, covering incidentals (hosting, 
etc), and the like.</p>
