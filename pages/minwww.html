<h1>MinWWW</h1>
Here's an outline and rationale for a minimal WWW proxy app for use
over <a href="iip-wiki?I2P&PHPSESSID=6e225478566d893d09caaefd76f406ce"><B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">I2P</B></a>.

<p>
HTTP operation over <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">I2P</B> using I2PTunnel.  When the base SocketLibrary
is out, the only significant difference will be the 'wrapRequest' and
'unwrapRequest' will functionally be placed in the socketLibrary, not
in the router (but later versions of the SocketLibrary will be able to
use selective ACK and large window sizes, allowing more ACKs to be
skipped)

An optimized form, designed to handle only 128KB [1] files and pages, can
operate significantly faster:

<p>
The difference in network load and latency is significant - this is essentially
a UDP version of HTTP.  On the normal web, we can't really do that, since most
HTTP requests and responses are orders of magnitude larger than UDP packets 
functionally support, but in <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">I2P</B>, messages can be large.  The savings for the
network load comes from the fact that we don't need to send any ACK messages -
rather than the earlier wrap/unwrap request (that bundles a DataMessage with
a DeliveryStatusMessage to provide guaranteed delivery), the MinWWW proxy deals
with resends (if necessary - in I2PTunnel today, there are no resends).
<p>
The data that the MinWWW proxy and server need to wrap is trivial - when the
proxy wants to send "GET /", it prepends it with the <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">I2P</B> Destination sending
the request, followed by a 4 byte request ID.  The MinWWW server receives those
requests, contacts the appropriate HTTPD, sends the request, waits for the 
response, and sends a reply to the MinWWW proxy containing the response, prefixed
with the original request ID.  That response is taken and passed back to the 
browser and the connection is closed.
<p>
In addition, the MinWWW proxy can choose the MinWWW server to use from a list, 
going through some round robin or other algorithm, so that there are multiple
outproxies merged transparently.  The bandwidth required for running one of 
these outproxies is also greatly reduced, since it will only handle 128KB files
(aka no one is going to be downloading porn, warez, etc).
<p>
The functionality /is/ limited, but 128KB of data is a lot for a single HTTP
request or response.  The above diagrams are also unrealistic in their hops -
ROUTERA will really never talk directly to ROUTERB.  ROUTERA will send each
of the messages through two additional outbound routers, then forwarded to
two additional inbound routers to ROUTERB, so the lag there is significant - 
while the above only saves 11 steps, 8 of those steps need to traverse the
entire <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">tunnel</B> path (4+ remote hops each time when tunnels are 2 remote hops
in each stretch), leaving MinWWW with only two full traversals (one for the
request, one for the response), instead of 10.

<p>
Implementing the MinWWW proxy and server should be fairly easy - read an HTTP
request from the client fully (perhaps only start out with HTTP GET, leaving
HTTP POST for later), wrap the message, and wait for the response.  The server
in turn simply needs to parse the request to either open a socket or URL,
send the request, wait for the response, and send it back through the network.
If someone were to implement this, it would be Good :)
<p>
[1] Why 128KB files?  Currently I2CP allows functionally arbitrary message size, 
but thats going to be going away since it involves either excessive memory 
overhead on intermediary routers, or additional implementation details to 
handle.  I2PTunnel is currently limited to 128KB and hasn't been a burden, 
so perhaps it could be increased to 256KB when the I2CP spec is updated)
