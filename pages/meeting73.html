[22:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 4) apps
[22:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 5) ???
[22:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 0) hi
[22:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hi everyone
[22:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; y'all seen http://i2p.dnsalias.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-January/000082.html?
[22:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; if not, now's your chance :)
[22:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; iip has been acting up a bit, so if someone could say something every once in a while, that'd be swell 
[22:02] &lt;MrEcho&gt; .
[22:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; w3rd
[22:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, moving on, 1) 0.2.3.4
[22:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there'll be a new release in the next day or so with the current state of the code, which includes a lot of bugfixes and more features
[22:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; e.g. tunnelmanager isn't in 0.2.3.3 yet
[22:03] &lt;MrEcho&gt; col
[22:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; it'll be backwards incompatible, because i'm mean
[22:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; jumping onto 2) 0.3
[22:04] &lt;MrEcho&gt; :P
[22:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; that'll be out fairly soon, but obviously not on thursday
[22:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; it won't be out until 0.2.3.4 is performing reliably so that everyone can reach all sites they should be able to
[22:05] &lt;MrEcho&gt; cool
[22:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; well, moving right along to 3) streaming lib / etc
[22:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; well, thats all spelled out in the email :)
[22:05] * eco has joined #i2p
[22:05] * mihi_away is now known as mihi
[22:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; if anyone wants to get involved in it, please let me know
[22:06] * ion has joined #i2p
[22:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 'lo eco, mihi, ion
[22:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, moving on to 4) apps 
[22:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone working on an app that will run over i2p that has anything to add?
[22:07] * wiht has joined #i2p
[22:07] &lt;MrEcho&gt; re ask the quest j
[22:07] &lt;jrand0m&gt; well, we're at the last agenda item, so might as well :)
[22:08] &lt;MrEcho&gt; wiht .. get my email?
[22:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone have anything to bring up outside the http://i2p.dnsalias.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-January/000082.html post?
[22:08] &lt;wiht&gt; Yes, let me read it.
[22:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; MrEcho&gt; have you read zooko's naming page yet?
[22:08] * jar has joined #i2p
[22:08] &lt;MrEcho&gt; no .. lost the link
[22:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (from the logs last week, http://zooko.com/distnames.html)
[22:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone have anything to add, or are we at a record breaking 10 minute meeting?
[22:10] &lt;MrEcho&gt; still working on my dns idea
[22:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; coo'
[22:10] &lt;wiht&gt; MrEcho: Yes, I would like to work together on naming service.
[22:10] &lt;MrEcho&gt; sweet
[22:11] &lt;wiht&gt; But I will not have time until next Wednesday.
[22:11] &lt;MrEcho&gt; ok
[22:11] &lt;MrEcho&gt; will give me some time to finish up on a few things
[22:11] &lt;mrflibble&gt; how long till the meet?
[22:11] &lt;jrand0m&gt; -11 minutes
[22:11] &lt;mrflibble&gt; oops
[22:11] * mrflibble is v late
[22:11] &lt;mrflibble&gt; :)
[22:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (we've gone through the 5 agenda items very very quicky :)
[22:12] * mrflibble goes back to lurking and the backscroll
[22:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh
[22:12] &lt;wiht&gt; jrand0m: Have you measured how much CPU is used per tunnel by the server?
[22:14] &lt;wiht&gt; Let me restate that: if you have five connections to other routers, and they are using 20% of CPU, how much will be used after 6th connection? Have you measured this?
[22:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; they shouldn't consume 20% of the cpu, or even 1%
[22:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (for client tunnels - server tunnels may consume more)
[22:15] &lt;wiht&gt; Server tunnels.
[22:16] * eco has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:16] &lt;wiht&gt; But that will probably be dependent on your CPU speed, so that was a badly stated question.
[22:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; server tunnels before the streaming lib will require cpu load whenever a new peer connects 
[22:18] &lt;wiht&gt; All right.
[22:19] &lt;duck&gt; are we at #5 already?
[22:19] * ion has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yup
[22:20] * duck mentions the hosting options that home.duck.i2p provides
[22:20] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ooOOoo
[22:20] &lt;duck&gt; it hasnt been tested by anybody besides me though
[22:20] &lt;duck&gt; waiting for betatester Ardvark to show up
[22:20] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so the hosting lets someone run apache / etc?
[22:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (or do they have to run the i2p router?
[22:21] &lt;duck&gt; neither
[22:21] &lt;duck&gt; they can put their html files on /home/username/public_html/
[22:21] &lt;duck&gt; and it will show up on http://home.duck.i2p/~username/
[22:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ah nice
[22:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; php support?  cgi / .pl / etc?  or just html?
[22:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (thats kick fucking ass, in any case)
[22:22] &lt;duck&gt; php and html
[22:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; wwwwwwwwwicked
[22:22] &lt;mihi&gt; duck: won't that compromize your anonymity?
[22:22] &lt;duck&gt; how?
[22:22] &lt;mihi&gt; phpshell?
[22:22] &lt;mihi&gt; or is the full apache in a vmware/UML box?
[22:22] &lt;duck&gt; system, exec, etc are disabled
[22:23] &lt;duck&gt; plus the host cant connect to the outsite
[22:23] * wilde has joined #i2p
[22:23] &lt;duck&gt; (it is inside an UML box)
[22:23] &lt;duck&gt; (pl and other cgis are too difficult to debug without shell access, plus they often break)
[22:23] * mihi_backup has joined #i2p
[22:23] &lt;jrand0m&gt; jsp access?  :)
[22:23] * madman2003 has quit IRC (12( www.nnscript.de 12:: NoNameScript 3.8 12:: www.XLhost.de 12))
[22:23] &lt;duck&gt; ofcourse not
[22:24] &lt;mihi&gt; and why not ssh access as well, when it's an UML box?
[22:24] &lt;duck&gt; because the average IIP user will start running forkbombs
[22:24] &lt;jrand0m&gt; with ssh access, they could traceroute i2p.dnsalias.net
[22:24] &lt;mihi&gt; man ulimit
[22:24] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ah true
[22:24] &lt;mihi&gt; man limiting cpu time on uml boxes.
[22:25] &lt;mihi&gt; (okay, it will crash apache, shit...)
[22:25] &lt;duck&gt; man run your own host :)
[22:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hehe
[22:25] &lt;lucky&gt; hi
[22:25] &lt;duck&gt; I'll add it on the todo
[22:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; a reliable hosting service provider will RULE
[22:25] &lt;kaji&gt; now all we need is a wiki
[22:25] * wiht has left #i2p (wiht)
[22:26] * lucky has a reliable net connection...
[22:26] &lt;duck&gt; you already have a wiki
[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; kaji&gt; duck.i2p has one
[22:26] &lt;duck&gt; wiki.invisiblenet.net
[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; that too
[22:26] &lt;kaji&gt; oh sweet then
[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (yeah, the main i2p wiki is http://wiki.invisiblenet.net/iip-wiki?I2P )
[22:26] * dm has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:28] * mihi is now known as mihi_away
[22:28] * mihi_backup has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
[22:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 'k, anything else before we close out the meeting?
[22:29] &lt;kaji&gt; doh, i missed the meeting?
[22:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we're not quite done yet, but about it
[22:29] &lt;lucky&gt; meeting?
[22:29] &lt;lucky&gt; Oh, thats so not fair
[22:29] &lt;lucky&gt; i just got home.
[22:29] &lt;wilde&gt; are there logs anywhere?
[22:29] &lt;wilde&gt; meeting log
[22:30] * lucky has a log...
[22:30] &lt;kaji&gt; can some one write a howto for using wget over i2p in windows?
[22:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; meeting logs at http://wiki.invisiblenet.net/iip-wiki?Meetings
[22:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; kaji you'll probably need to add the http_proxy to the environment
[22:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, lets wrap this one up, and I'll post up the logs momentarily.  anyone who has anything else can post to the mailing list or just chat on here :)
[22:32] &lt;kaji&gt; also im now sharing /books/ and /audio/ at kaji.i2p and i think i will make a short howto about the bugs in apache alias for windows
[22:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; word kaji!
[22:32] * jrand0m *baf*s the meeting closed on that note
