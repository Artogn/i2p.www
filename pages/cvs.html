<p>This is just a reminder for me so I don't have to memorize the commands to
download i2p cvs.  For those who aren't very familiar with cvs, there is a 
<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">fantastic book</a> on the 
subject (developers only need to deal with the first chapter - "An Overview of CVS",
as subsequent chapters go into some nasty details very few ever need to touch).</p>

<h2>Unix CVS</h2>
<code>cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.i2p.net:/cvsroot login</code><br />
Password: anoncvs<br />
<code>cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.i2p.net:/cvsroot co i2p</code>

<h2>WinCVS</h2>
<p>WinCVS CVSRoot (login then checkout):</p>
<code>anoncvs@cvs.i2p.net:/cvsroot</code><br />
Password: anoncvs

<h2>CVSWeb</h2>
<a href="http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/?f=H">I2P CVSWeb (w/ nice diffs)</a><br />
<p>Humourous quote from WinCVS: "Did you know...  Never experiment with new CVS
commands on your working repository.  Create a sample module instead."</p>
