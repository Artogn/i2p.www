<p>To improve I2P's maintainability, we want to have a solid set of
automated unit tests for the critical code.  While we do have some
unit tests at the moment, they are ad-hoc.  This bounty is for 
someone to move the tests over to jUnit, automate their execution,
extend them to provide better code coverage, and publish the report 
online.  Its a massive effort, but can be broken down in phases:</p>

<h2>Phase 1: <a name="sdk">SDK test migration</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: $150</b><br />

<p>To collect this bounty, the existing SDK tests must be moved over
to jUnit, integrated into the ant build scripts ("ant test"), and
tied in with a code coverage tool (e.g. 
<a href="http://www.cenqua.com/clover/">Clover</a>).  The ant script
must be capable of generating test status results as a web page, 
which will be published online.</p>

<h2>Phase 2: <a name="sdk_coverage">SDK test coverage</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: $100</b><br />

<p>To collect this bounty, the automated unit tests must meet a 
measured code coverage of 90% of the SDK (i2p/core/java/src).</p>

<h2>Phase 3: <a name="router">Router test migration</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: $50</b><br />

<p>As with phase 1, the existing unit tests for the router must be
moved over to the automated system.</p>

<h2>Phase 4: <a name="router_coverage">Router test coverage</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: $100</b><br />

<p>To collect this bounty, the automated unit tests must meet a 
measured code coverage of 90% of the router (i2p/router/java/src).</p>

<h2>Phase 5: <a name="streaming">Streaming lib tests</a></h2>
<b>Bounty: $100</b><br />

<p>To collect this bounty, a new set of unit tests must meet a 
measured code coverage of 90% of the streaming lib 
(i2p/apps/ministreaming/ and i2p/apps/streaming/).</p>
