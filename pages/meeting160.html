<p>15:15 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>15:15  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>15:15 &lt; jrandom&gt; weekly status notes posted up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-December/001239.html</p>
<p>15:15 &lt; jrandom&gt; (*before* the meeting this week - who woulda thunk it?)</p>
<p>15:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; not that it matters, since y'all wait until the meeting starts to read it anyway ;)</p>
<p>15:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; so, movin' on in to 1) Net status and load testing</p>
<p>15:16 &lt;@cervantes&gt; hey!</p>
<p>15:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; thanks for doing your part cervantes ;)</p>
<p>15:17 &lt;@cervantes&gt; read what?</p>
<p>15:17 -!- DreamTheaterFan [anonymous@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]</p>
<p>15:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; I don't have much to add beyond whats in the mail, anyone have any questions or comments on 1)?</p>
<p>15:19 &lt; spaetz&gt; is load testing performed on *the* i2p net or do you have a private net for this?</p>
<p>15:19 &lt; jrandom&gt; I'm doing it on the live net</p>
<p>15:19 &lt; spaetz&gt; just curious</p>
<p>15:19 &lt; spaetz&gt; k</p>
<p>15:20 &lt; jrandom&gt; its being done carefully though, backing off hard from peers under load, and it of course honors tunnel rejections</p>
<p>15:20 &lt;@cervantes&gt; recent irc2p instability was unrelated to the tests</p>
<p>15:21 &lt;@cervantes&gt; (in case you were wondering)</p>
<p>15:21 &lt; jrandom&gt; hows the new setup handling things cervantes?  </p>
<p>15:21 &lt;@cervantes&gt; been rock solid so far</p>
<p>15:22 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool</p>
<p>15:22 &lt;@cervantes&gt; just took some tedium to track down the source of the gremlins</p>
<p>15:24 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone else have any questions/omments, or shall we jump on over to 2) I2PSnark?</p>
<p>15:25 &lt; jrandom&gt; consider us jumped</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, basically I2PSnark should work again... there were a few attributes not yet in the BT spec but used by azureus and rufus, causing incompatibility, but we're now compatible with the situations I was able to see</p>
<p>15:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; i2psnark now works with all of the torrents i've tested, but if anyone runs into trouble, let me know</p>
<p>15:27 &lt; jrandom&gt; part of the drive for me to fix that up was in relation to some SAM bugs, since I2PSnark doesn't use SAM</p>
<p>15:28 &lt; jrandom&gt; not much more to add on that front... unless anyone has any questions, lets move on over to 3) Syndie</p>
<p>15:29 -!- Xunk [Xunk@irc2p] has quit [Connection reset by peer]</p>
<p>15:30 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, I don't have much to add beyond the email on that front either</p>
<p>15:31 -!- Xunk [Xunk@irc2p] has joined #i2p</p>
<p>15:31 &lt; jrandom&gt; if there aren't any questions re: Syndie, lets continue on and open the floor with 4) ???</p>
<p>15:31 -!- DreamTheaterFan [anonymous@irc2p] has joined #i2p</p>
<p>15:32  * jrandom remembers that clunk wasn't in the agenda, among other things.  anyone have anything they want to bring up?</p>
