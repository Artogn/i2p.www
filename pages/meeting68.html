<p>[22:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 0) welcome  </p>
<p>[22:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hi </p>
<p>[22:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; this is meeting 67 or 68...  </p>
<p>[22:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1) iip status </p>
<p>[22:03] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I dunno.  anyone know what the situation has been as of late? </p>
<p>[22:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the iip devs aren't here, so... dunno. </p>
<p>[22:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; [ping] </p>
<p>[22:04] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (last week I typed for probably 10 minutes before my client pinged me out...) </p>
<p>[22:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (i'm not going to type anything else until I get a p0ng, damnit ;) </p>
<p>[22:05] *** Nostradumbass (nostradum@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:05] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 'lo Nostradumbass </p>
<p>[22:06] &lt;Nostradumbass&gt; hi :)</p>
<p>[22:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok cool, so I haven't pinged out, people are just lurking.  cool :) </p>
<p>[22:06] * jrand0m hops on to the next agenda item</p>
<p>[22:06] &lt;Nostradumbass&gt; how's i2p coming?</p>
<p>[22:06] &lt;Nostradumbass&gt; sorry?</p>
<p>[22:06] &lt;jrand0m&gt; good lead in ;) </p>
<p>[22:07] &lt;jrand0m&gt; agenda item 3) i2p 0.2.3 status :) </p>
<p>[22:07] *** nerox (~nerox@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:07] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there's been a lot of progress, even though I'm offline.  commited a truckload of code a few hours ago </p>
<p>[22:07] &lt;jrand0m&gt; that includes an implementation of the kademlia netDb </p>
<p>[22:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so I'm pretty confident we'll hit the release for 0.2.3 next week (which is basically kademlia netDb + a shell script) </p>
<p>[22:08] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there have been a few more variations on the kademlia proto though to make things more relevent for i2p </p>
<p>[22:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we will always have a very, very, /very/ sparse kademlia tree. </p>
<p>[22:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 2^256 possible slots, and 1-10 values per peer in the network. </p>
<p>[22:09] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so, thinking insanely overzealous, we still wont be using jack shit, and everything will be in the furthest out kbucket </p>
<p>[22:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so some parts of kademlia are going to be quietly ignored ;)  but the basic gist stays the same, including the search algo &amp; distance metric </p>
<p>[22:10] &lt;jrand0m&gt; idn, however, is dead in the water. </p>
<p>[22:11] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the idea that i2p's netDb code could run off the same code as a publishing DHT was a silly little idea </p>
<p>[22:11] &lt;jrand0m&gt; and has been promptly abandonded. </p>
<p>[22:11] &lt;jrand0m&gt; idn is still generally a good idea, but I'm not going to spend my i2p dev time working on it </p>
<p>[22:12] *** tusko (~tusko@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but part of the 0.2.3 changes include a dramatic revamp of how we choose peers and organize router stats </p>
<p>[22:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heya tusko </p>
<p>[22:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; that brings us to agenda item 3) peer profiling </p>
<p>[22:12] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I've been pretty silly...and finally did some of the math </p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the stats being gathered now are immense. </p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; about 6000 data points /per peer/ </p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;duck&gt; what is peer profiling?</p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; peer profiling is where the router keeps track of the performance of each peer so that it can decide who to use in the future </p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;duck&gt; ah</p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (aka fast routers, reliable routers, etc) </p>
<p>[22:13] &lt;duck&gt; the process that eats up my memory :)</p>
<p>[22:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; heh actually that part isn't toooo bad </p>
<p>[22:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; though 6000 data points won't scale. </p>
<p>[22:14] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 1000 routers @ 6000 data points each @ 4 bytes / data point = 24Mb </p>
<p>[22:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; though keeping detailed stats on a few hundred peers is probably fine, even as the net grows beyond that </p>
<p>[22:15] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we /don't/ need to keep stats on everyone.  just routers we want to 'use' for our tunnels, garlic routing, and source routing. </p>
<p>[22:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we could probably get away in the long term with just keeping track of a hundred or so peers. </p>
<p>[22:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but, for now, I'm going to say fuckit. </p>
<p>[22:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; keep stats on all peers </p>
<p>[22:16] &lt;duck&gt; ping</p>
<p>[22:16] &lt;jrand0m&gt; p0ng </p>
<p>[22:17] &lt;duck&gt; will it try to learn about all peers?</p>
<p>[22:17] &lt;jrand0m&gt; right now, yes </p>
<p>[22:17] &lt;duck&gt; oh wait, your last lines covered that</p>
<p>[22:17] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we also have some code for coallescing and running calculations on the peer profiles </p>
<p>[22:18] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so one of those calculators will determine what peers to drop </p>
<p>[22:18] &lt;jrand0m&gt; an example of the data set being collected: (Link: http://i2p.dnsalias.net/~jrandom/profile.txt)http://i2p.dnsalias.net/~jrandom/profile.txt </p>
<p>[22:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (you'll notice lots of 0s :) </p>
<p>[22:19] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I've written up a rough manifesto for peer selection and profiling, but need to get that onto the wiki </p>
<p>[22:20] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but thats all 0.3 stuff, really.  0.2.3 just uses a little of it </p>
<p>[22:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, thats it for the peer profiling.  lots more later, just giving a lil view into whats up </p>
<p>[22:21] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (of course, as always, anyone who wants to get down and dirty and figure out what other stats / calculations / attacks / etc should be used would be *very* much appreciated) </p>
<p>[22:22] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, 4) i2p services </p>
<p>[22:23] &lt;jrand0m&gt; tc's site is awesome &amp; really reliable!  I finally got to nightblade's page as well, and its a cool blog ('plog' ;).. I just wish I could leave comments :) </p>
<p>[22:23] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there's also duck's jabber server, which works fairly easily with the instructions posted to tc's board </p>
<p>[22:24] &lt;jrand0m&gt; things sometimes act up a bit, but thats related to some bugs in the router &lt;= 0.2.2, and have been fixed (and will roll out in 0.2.3) </p>
<p>[22:24] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the squid proxy is generally offline, since I'm offline too much to babysit my kaffe routers :/ </p>
<p>[22:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so for the moment, the eepsites and the jabber chat is probably the most reliable things on i2p, all running on top of i2ptunnel </p>
<p>[22:25] &lt;jrand0m&gt; what services would be cool to show up next? </p>
<p>[22:25] &lt;duck&gt; I did try to run an ircd over i2ptunnel</p>
<p>[22:25] &lt;duck&gt; but before it got the full MOTD after logging in, I got ping timeouted already</p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; d'oh </p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;duck&gt; and that was on the same router</p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;duck&gt; so in the wild performance will be even worse</p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; on the local router it pinged out?! </p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; local router should never ping anything out </p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh, except for that race bug </p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (which is probably what it was, since it was local and the race is faster there) </p>
<p>[22:26] &lt;duck&gt; irc client pinged out for not responding in time</p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;duck&gt; I'll retry with 0.2.3</p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; word </p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;duck&gt; though jabber is nice for now</p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; totally </p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; and long term, irc is not the way to go </p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;duck&gt; tc, jrandom and me are there to chat with!</p>
<p>[22:27] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hehe :) </p>
<p>[22:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we need an IM and group chat solution that doesn't give cleartext to anyone unauthorized, and doesn't require centralized choke points </p>
<p>[22:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (aka iip 2.0) </p>
<p>[22:28] &lt;jrand0m&gt; now would be a nice time for userx to come back into the fold ;) </p>
<p>[22:29] * jrand0m stops holding breath</p>
<p>[22:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; an nntp server would /also/ really really rule. </p>
<p>[22:29] &lt;duck&gt; I'll try that tomorrow</p>
<p>[22:29] &lt;jrand0m&gt; r0x0r </p>
<p>[22:30] &lt;duck&gt; jabber is really nice to run other things over</p>
<p>[22:30] &lt;duck&gt; check out the jabber rpc specs</p>
<p>[22:30] &lt;duck&gt; (Link: http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/jrpc/)http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/jrpc/</p>
<p>[22:30] &lt;duck&gt; other services?</p>
<p>[22:30] &lt;jrand0m&gt; thats interesting - doing jabber as a naming service, essentially </p>
<p>[22:31] &lt;duck&gt; you mean:</p>
<p>[22:31] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there will always be more services to add - with mail (usenet), chat (jabber) and publishing/browsing (eepsites), there's good coverage </p>
<p>[22:31] &lt;duck&gt; name server has a jabber client through which you can register names (provided token)</p>
<p>[22:31] &lt;duck&gt; also use it to query?</p>
<p>[22:31] &lt;jrand0m&gt; naw </p>
<p>[22:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; jabber's registry being the naming service </p>
<p>[22:32] &lt;duck&gt; ok</p>
<p>[22:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; its centralized but it works </p>
<p>[22:32] &lt;jrand0m&gt; just like hosts.txt :) </p>
<p>[22:33] &lt;duck&gt; are there mail solutions that are better suited for there environments than smtp and pop/imap ?</p>
<p>[22:33] &lt;jrand0m&gt; thats a really good question </p>
<p>[22:33] &lt;duck&gt; cause I dont think that it will just work when you hook up mail servers</p>
<p>[22:34] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, it'd probably need either a gateway (ala freemail) or the naming service doing some interesting tap dancing </p>
<p>[22:34] &lt;jrand0m&gt; or it reverts back to centralized single POP3/IMAP server with everyone on the same server </p>
<p>[22:35] &lt;duck&gt; I spoke with aum (author of freemail) yesterday</p>
<p>[22:35] &lt;duck&gt; he was talking about reimplementing fred in python</p>
<p>[22:35] &lt;jrand0m&gt; lol nice </p>
<p>[22:35] *** mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:35] &lt;duck&gt; so I did suggest him to work on the python routers for i2p instead</p>
<p>[22:35] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ooh that would TOTALLY rule! </p>
<p>[22:35] &lt;duck&gt; then he got totally upset about the pdf documents</p>
<p>[22:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hey, if he wants the openOffice originals, or even a txt export I'll export </p>
<p>[22:36] &lt;duck&gt; and I lost my patience and told him that you would also have the m$word docs if he did ask nicely</p>
<p>[22:36] &lt;duck&gt; well, you were a fuckhead for not doing a html export or something</p>
<p>[22:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; naw, I tried that ;) </p>
<p>[22:36] &lt;duck&gt; I lost my patience and told him to talk to you</p>
<p>[22:36] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the openOffice html export SUCKS </p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;duck&gt; hm</p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;mrflibble&gt; true jr</p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; when the specs turn 1.0 (aka when the router turns 1.0 and they're updated to match the code), they'll be on the wiki. </p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;duck&gt; wiki has most info though</p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; exactly </p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;mrflibble&gt; i tried using that for that kevin mitnick book. it was worse than ms office</p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;duck&gt; oh well</p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; zactly. </p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;duck&gt; he might appear here once</p>
<p>[22:37] &lt;jrand0m&gt; that'd be awesome </p>
<p>[22:38] &lt;duck&gt; but maybe it is better with his attitude to join the freenet gang</p>
<p>[22:38] &lt;duck&gt; ...</p>
<p>[22:38] &lt;jrand0m&gt; well, effort on freenet is always a good thing </p>
<p>[22:38] * duck goes back to beeing friendly</p>
<p>[22:38] &lt;jrand0m&gt; :) </p>
<p>[22:38] &lt;duck&gt; aums work rocks</p>
<p>[22:38] &lt;duck&gt; hopefully he'll rock on i2p</p>
<p>[22:39] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah whenever someone talked about searching on freenet, I always just said "well just do a McNabb" </p>
<p>[22:39] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we need the help, certainly </p>
<p>[22:39] &lt;duck&gt; which brings me to the following question:</p>
<p>[22:39] &lt;duck&gt; are the changes to I2P that you do specced?</p>
<p>[22:39] &lt;duck&gt; or is the java source the documentation for the latest info</p>
<p>[22:40] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there are notes taken in my palmpilot, filesystem, and notebook, but unfortunately I haven't updated the openoffice docs in a while </p>
<p>[22:40] &lt;jrand0m&gt; feb is doc-month for jrandom. </p>
<p>[22:40] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (and qa, and bugfixing) </p>
<p>[22:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ((and benders ;)) </p>
<p>[22:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the specs are still pretty much correct, there are just more details. </p>
<p>[22:41] &lt;duck&gt; awesome</p>
<p>[22:41] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but the datastructures have had more changes </p>
<p>[22:42] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, anything else for services?   </p>
<p>[22:43] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, 5) stuff </p>
<p>[22:43] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hi </p>
<p>[22:43] &lt;duck&gt; hi!</p>
<p>[22:43] &lt;jrand0m&gt; how's tricks? </p>
<p>[22:43] &lt;jrand0m&gt; [any questions / thoughts / issues / etc go here] </p>
<p>[22:43] &lt;duck&gt; the base64 tricks should be added to the i2ptricks pages</p>
<p>[22:44] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ooh good point </p>
<p>[22:44] &lt;duck&gt; might be some other tricks too that I dont know yet</p>
<p>[22:44] &lt;duck&gt; will grep the sources for 'main'</p>
<p>[22:44] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I feel guilty for not having the installer let someoene automatically fetch hosts.txt and reseed </p>
<p>[22:44] &lt;jrand0m&gt; lol </p>
<p>[22:44] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there are lots and lots of main() methods, but they're mostly test functions </p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; oh! </p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; one thing.  DONT run the current code from cvs and expect it to work with normal routers. </p>
<p>[22:45] *** joda (--@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;joda&gt; hi</p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; the db messages changed :) </p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hi joda </p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;joda&gt; sorry, if I interrupt something</p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;duck&gt; I got a bit upset that I couldnt get cvs to work</p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;duck&gt; but then I did remember that this isnt freenet</p>
<p>[22:45] &lt;joda&gt; I was just wondering what happend to "anonymail" ?</p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;duck&gt; so you dont need latest cvs to be able to use it</p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; joda&gt; the user who runs it doesn't seem to be online at the moment.  should be back soon </p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hehe duck - did it fail for you today after I committed, or do you mean from before today? </p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;duck&gt; last week somewhere</p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;joda&gt; jrand&gt; thx :)</p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;joda&gt; cu :)</p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ah 'k duck </p>
<p>[22:46] &lt;jrand0m&gt; l8r joda </p>
<p>[22:47] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, I only endorse running the released code </p>
<p>[22:47] &lt;duck&gt; will 0.2.3 put the version files in a directory? :)</p>
<p>[22:47] &lt;jrand0m&gt; 0.2.3 gets rid of the version files :) </p>
<p>[22:47] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (lots and lots and lots of changes) </p>
<p>[22:47] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but that means 0.2.3 (and beyond) will require g enerally correct clocks </p>
<p>[22:48] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (current Router.CLOCK_FUDGE_FACTOR = 30 minutes) </p>
<p>[22:48] &lt;duck&gt; what will the fudge facter be for 0.2.3?</p>
<p>[22:48] &lt;jrand0m&gt; probably the same </p>
<p>[22:49] *** joda has left #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;duck&gt; oh, current = your code</p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;jrand0m&gt; that time will be used to expire db entries </p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;duck&gt; k</p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ah, right, yeah :) </p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (in 0.2.2 that clock_fudge_factor is spread out throughout half a dozen files) </p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;duck&gt; maybe the installer could be a bit more userfriendly</p>
<p>[22:49] &lt;duck&gt; as in less questions</p>
<p>[22:49] *** Signoff: nickthief66282 (Excess Flood)</p>
<p>[22:50] &lt;duck&gt; default phttp urls included, no bandwidth limiting etc</p>
<p>[22:50] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I guess we could autoguess random ports too </p>
<p>[22:50] &lt;jrand0m&gt; you're right </p>
<p>[22:50] &lt;jrand0m&gt; want commit privs?  :) </p>
<p>[22:50] *** Signoff: nerox (EOF From client)</p>
<p>[22:50] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (if not I can update it for 0.2.3) </p>
<p>[22:51] &lt;duck&gt; an argument against it can be that users will take settings too easily for granted</p>
<p>[22:51] &lt;duck&gt; and everybody uses the same phttp relay</p>
<p>[22:51] *** nickthief24373 (~chatzilla@anon.iip) has joined channel #iip-dev</p>
<p>[22:51] &lt;jrand0m&gt; true.  though 0.3.1 plans include an update to the phttp relay code to let relays talk to each other, and redirect users to a less loaded relay </p>
<p>[22:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; i'm generally happy with the install process atm though - i built a new 0.2.2 install and was browsing tc's page in under a minute </p>
<p>[22:52] &lt;jrand0m&gt; (though thats because i know what all the text says and didn't read it...) </p>
<p>[22:52] &lt;duck&gt; I dont like the long keys</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;duck&gt; especially not if you have to copy&amp;paste them</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;duck&gt; better use them as file</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm? </p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;duck&gt; but distributing the binary files are a pain</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;duck&gt; so you have to do the base64 trick..</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;duck&gt; could the i2ptunnel read base64 destination keys too?</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;duck&gt; from a file that is</p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; I was just typing that ;) </p>
<p>[22:53] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, that wouldnt be much work </p>
<p>[22:54] &lt;jrand0m&gt; perhaps even 1 line </p>
<p>[22:54] &lt;duck&gt; also, what about armouring?</p>
<p>[22:54] &lt;duck&gt; with a header&amp;footer</p>
<p>[22:54] &lt;duck&gt; like pgp etc</p>
<p>[22:55] &lt;jrand0m&gt; true, it would be useful to have that sort of validation </p>
<p>[22:55] &lt;duck&gt; ofcourse that is a gadget</p>
<p>[22:55] &lt;duck&gt; but it could be helpful for those who want to use the tunnel</p>
<p>[22:55] &lt;jrand0m&gt; though the Destination structure itself is pretty picky </p>
<p>[22:55] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but you're right, a raw base64 isn't the most intuitive or safe thing to pass around </p>
<p>[22:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we need a bugzilla </p>
<p>[22:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so things like this can get posted as todo </p>
<p>[22:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; i'd move off my palm's todo list for that </p>
<p>[22:56] &lt;duck&gt; bugzilla has nazi registration requirements</p>
<p>[22:56] &lt;duck&gt; with emails etc..</p>
<p>[22:56] &lt;jrand0m&gt; true </p>
<p>[22:57] &lt;duck&gt; but better as nothing</p>
<p>[22:57] &lt;duck&gt; other bugtrackers all have their shortcomings</p>
<p>[22:57] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, every company i've worked at has pretty much ended building their own </p>
<p>[22:58] &lt;jrand0m&gt; we'll see.  we need a bugtracker by the time we start doing full on qa (once 0.3 comes out) </p>
<p>[22:58] &lt;jrand0m&gt; so we've got a few weeks ;) </p>
<p>[22:58] &lt;jrand0m&gt; but if someone did some research and found a really nice one, that'd be great </p>
<p>[22:59] &lt;jrand0m&gt; [not you specifically duck, anyone who's reading these meeting logs at home ;)] </p>
<p>[22:59] &lt;duck&gt; so far phpBugTrackers has been okay for me</p>
<p>[22:59] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm haven't used that </p>
<p>[22:59] &lt;duck&gt; yes, I am not talking to jrandom either</p>
<p>[22:59] &lt;jrand0m&gt; lol </p>
<p>[22:59] &lt;duck&gt; but to the group of I2P code developers :)</p>
<p>[22:59] * jrand0m is actually 12 people acting under a single nym</p>
<p>[23:00] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ok, 1 hour, on the dot </p>
<p>[23:00] &lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone else have anything before I get the *baf*er out? </p>
<p>[23:01] * duck demands 1 more minute</p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;duck&gt; since we did start on 21:02</p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah yeah </p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; la la la </p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; what should i have for dinner? </p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; there's a nice falafel place next door... </p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; had gnocci for lunch too </p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm... </p>
<p>[23:01] &lt;jrand0m&gt; maybe a liquid dinner </p>
<p>[23:02] &lt;duck&gt; soup?</p>
<p>[23:02] &lt;jrand0m&gt; ooOooo whiskey soup! </p>
<p>[23:02] * jrand0m *baf*'s the meeting closed on that note</p>
