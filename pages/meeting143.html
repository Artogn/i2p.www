<p>13:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>13:09  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>13:09 &lt;@jrandom&gt; weekly status notes up @ http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2005-August/000842.html</p>
<p>13:10 &lt;@jrandom&gt; (which i'm sure you've all read studiously)</p>
<p>13:10 &lt;@postman&gt; hi</p>
<p>13:10 &lt;+cervantes&gt; hmm changate perl scripts...will give them a go...</p>
<p>13:10 &lt;+cervantes&gt; hi</p>
<p>13:10 &lt;@jrandom&gt; 1) peer test status</p>
<p>13:11 &lt;@jrandom&gt; not too much to add on this beyond what i posted in the notes - anyone have any questions/comments/concerns with it?</p>
<p>13:11 &lt;@jrandom&gt; i'm not sure whether to verify the remote reachability of everyone who connects to us, but i'm toying with that idea</p>
<p>13:11 &lt;@jrandom&gt; (we do that now with tcp)</p>
<p>13:13 &lt;@jrandom&gt; well, perhaps we can try it without that on a 0.6.0.3 before moving to 0.6.1.  ve zhall zee</p>
<p>13:13 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, moving on to 2) irc2p</p>
<p>13:13 &lt;@jrandom&gt; y'all are here, so you know whats up :)</p>
<p>13:13 &lt;@jrandom&gt; nice work postman & smeghead</p>
<p>13:16 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, smeghead & postman have been putting out plenty of info on that thaang, so if there's nothing else y'all want to bring up on that, we can swing over to 3) feedspace</p>
<p>13:16 &lt;@jrandom&gt; frosk seems to have stepped out, and i don't really have anything to add beyond whats in the notes (and on his blog)</p>
<p>13:17 &lt;@postman&gt; :)</p>
<p>13:17  * Complication is reading frosk's blog</p>
<p>13:18 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, perhaps frosk'll fill us in with a post there when there's more info to share</p>
<p>13:19 &lt;@jrandom&gt; movin' on briefly to 4) meta</p>
<p>13:19 &lt;@jrandom&gt; what are y'all's thoughts on 8p GMT meetings?  too early, too late, just right?</p>
<p>13:21  * jrandom holds back the crowds</p>
<p>13:21 &lt;+Complication&gt; I'd like to say something useful, but cannot seem to find my world clock...</p>
<p>13:21 &lt;@jrandom&gt; google://what+time+is+it</p>
<p>13:22 &lt;+Complication&gt; :)</p>
<p>13:22 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, movin' on to 5) ???</p>
<p>13:22 &lt;@jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else they want to bring up?</p>
<p>13:23 &lt;+susi23&gt; well</p>
<p>13:23 &lt;+susi23&gt; not officially ;)</p>
<p>13:24 &lt;+Complication&gt; It's been an unusually stable time.</p>
<p>13:24 &lt;+Complication&gt; Aside from occasional "message invalid" (or was it "packet invalid"), I can't find errors to report. :o</p>
<p>13:24 &lt;@postman&gt; my errors are already reported :)</p>
<p>13:24 &lt;@jrandom&gt; coo', though thats unfortunately a symptom of undetected errors Complication, since there's still some stuff not going as it Should</p>
<p>13:25 &lt;@jrandom&gt; but, progress, ever onwards</p>
<p>13:25 &lt;@jrandom&gt; perhaps we're seeing a lot of restricted routes out there due to the udp situation</p>
<p>13:25 &lt;+susi23&gt; we started a new idlerpg on #idle and you are all invited to join :)</p>
<p>13:25 &lt;@jrandom&gt; (and perhaps there's a bunch of other things...)</p>
<p>13:25 &lt;@jrandom&gt; w00t susi23 </p>
<p>13:26 &lt;+susi23&gt; :P</p>
<p>13:30 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, anyone else have something to bring up for the meeting?</p>
<p>13:32 &lt;@jrandom&gt; ok, if there's nothin' else</p>
<p>13:32  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>13:32  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
