<p>
As briefly explained in the <a href="how_intro.html">intro</a>, I2P builds virtual "tunnels" -
temporary and unidirectional paths through a sequence of routers.  These 
tunnels can be categorized as either inbound tunnels (where everything 
given to it goes towards the creator of the tunnel) and outbound tunnels
(where the tunnel creator shoves messages away from them).  When Alice
wants to send a message to Bob, she will (typically) send it out one of
her existing outbound tunnels with instructions for that tunnel's endpoint
to forward it to the gateway router for one of Bob's current inbound 
tunnels, which in turn passes it to Bob.

<H2>Tunnel vocabulary</H2>

<p>
<UL>
<li> <b>Tunnel gateway</b> - the first router in a tunnel.  For inbound tunnels, this is the one mentioned in the 
        LeaseSet published in the <a href="how_networkdatabase.html">network database</a>.  For outbound tunnels, the 
        gateway is the originating router.  (e.g. both A and D above)
</UL>
<p>
<UL>

<li> <b>Tunnel endpoint</b> - the last router in a tunnel.  (e.g. both C and F above)
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <b> Tunnel particiant</b> - all routers in a tunnel except for the gateway or endpoint (e.g. both B and E above)
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <b>n-Hop tunnel</b> - a tunnel with a specific number of inter-router jumps, e.g.:

<UL>
<li> <b>0-hop tunnel</b> - a tunnel where the gateway is also the endpoint
<li> <b>1-hop tunnel</b> - a tunnel where the gateway talks directly to the endpoint
<li> <b>2-(or more)-hop tunnel</b> - a tunnel where there is at least one tunnel participant. (the above diagram includes two 
        2-hop tunnels - one outbound from Alice, one inbound to Bob)
</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<UL>

<li> <b>Tunnel lifetime</b> - how long a particular tunnel is supposed to be in operation for (each client specifies this 
        when contacting their router, and the router makes sure sufficient tunnels meeting that criteria are built)
</UL>
<p>
<H2>Tunnel information</H2>

<p>
Routers performing the three roles (gateway, endpoint, participant) are given different pieces of data to accomplish their tasks:
<p>
<UL>
<li> <b>The tunnel gateway gets:</b>
<UL>

<li> <b>tunnel signing key</b> - a DSA private key for authenticating messages sent down the tunnel
<li> <b>tunnel encryption key</b> - an AES private key for encrypting messages and instructions to the endpoint
<li> <b>tunnel id</b> - 4 byte integer (each router can obviously only have one tunnel with each tunnel id at any time)
<li> <b>next hop [optional]</b> - what router is the next one in the path
<li> <b>configuration key</b> - an AES private key used by the tunnel's creator for updating the tunnel later on (if necessary)

</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <b>The tunnel endpoint gets:</b>
<UL>
<li> <b>tunnel verification key</b> - a DSA public key for authenticating messages sent down the tunnel
<li> <b>tunnel encryption key</b> - an AES private key for decrypting messages and instructions sent by the gateway
<li> <b>tunnel id</b> - 4 byte integer (each router can obviously only have one tunnel with each tunnel id at any time)

<li> <b>configuration key</b> - an AES private key used by the tunnel's creator for updating the tunnel later on (if necessary)
</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<li> <b>All tunnel participants get:</b>
<UL>
<li> <b>tunnel verification key</b> - a DSA public key for authenticating messages sent down the tunnel
<li> <b>tunnel id</b> - 4 byte integer (each router can obviously only have one tunnel with each tunnel id at any time)

<li> <b>next hop [optional]</b> - what router is the next one in the path
<li> <b>configuration key</b> - an AES private key used by the tunnel's creator for updating the tunnel later on (if necessary)
</UL>
</UL>
<p>
In addition, there are a series of options that the creator of a tunnel sends when requesting a router
to join a tunnel, such as the expiration date.  In I2P 3.0, options specifying the pooling, mixing, and chaff 
generation settings will be honored, and limits on the quantity and size of messages allowed during the tunnel's
lifetime will be implemented earlier (e.g. no more than 300 messages or 1MB per minute).
<p>
<H2>Tunnel length</H2>

<p>

As mentioned above, each client requests that their router provide tunnels to include at least
a certain number of hops (plus other criteria that aren't honored yet, such as bandwidth limits, etc).
The decision as to how many routers to have in one's outbound and inbound tunnels has an important
effect upon the latency, throughput, reliabilty, and anonymity provided by I2P - the more peers that 
messages have to go through, the longer it takes to get there and the more likely that one of those 
routers will fail prematurely.  The less routers in a tunnel, the easier it is for an adversary to 
mount traffic analysis attacks and pierce someone's anonymity.  
<p>
<H3>0-hop tunnels</H3>

<p>
With no remote routers in a tunnel, the user has very basic plausible deniability (since no one knows 
for sure that the peer that sent them the message wasn't simply just forwarding it on as part of the tunnel).
However, it would be fairly easy to mount a statistical analysis attack and notice that messages targetting 
a specific destination are always sent through a single gateway.  Statistical analysis against outbound 0-hop
tunnels are more complex, but could show similar information (though would be slightly harder to mount)
<p>
<H3>1-hop tunnels</H3>

<p>
With only one remote router in a tunnel, the user has both plausible deniability and basic anonymity, as long
as they are not up against an internal adversary (as described on <a href="how_threatmodel.html">threat model</a>).  However, if the adversary
ran a sufficient number of routers such that the single remote router in the tunnel is often one of those 
compromised ones, they would be able to mount the above statistical traffic analysis attack.
<p>
<H3>2-hop (or more) tunnels</H3>

<p>
With two or more remote routers in a tunnel, the costs of mouting the traffic analysis attack increases, since
all remote routers would have to be compromised to mount it.
<p>
The router will by default use <b>2-hop tunnels</b>, at least in the main distribution.  Prior to the 0.2.5 release,
all tunnels are 1-hop by default.
<p>
<H2>Tunnel pooling</H2>

<p>
[explain tunnel pools, how we keep a free inbound pool, an outbound pool, and a client inbound pool, and how the
pools are refreshed every minute or so, using the router's default settings]
<p>
<H2>Tunnel testing</H2>

<p>
All tunnels are periodically tested by their creator by sending a DeliveryStatusMessage out the tunnel and bound
for another inbound tunnel (testing both tunnels at once).  If either fails, both are marked as no longer functional,
and if they were used for a client's inbound tunnel, a new leaseSet is created.  Other techniques can be used to test
tunnels later on, such as garlic wrapping a number of tests into cloves, testing individual tunnel participants 
seperately (and using the tunnel configuration key to update the next hop to work around failures), etc, but that is
not implemented at the moment.
<p>
<H2>Tunnel creation</H2>

<p>
Tunnel creation is handled by <a href="how_garlicrouting.html">garlic routing</a>) a TunnelCreateMessage to a router, 
requesting that they participate in the tunnel (providing them with all of the appropriate information, as above, 
along with a certificate, which right now is a 'null' cert, but will support hashcash or other non-free certificates 
when necessary).  The message also includes a SourceRouteReplyBlock, which allows the router to encrypt their 
TunnelCreateStatusMessage into a SourceRouteReplyMessage, which is sent to another router (specified in the 
SourceRouteReplyBlock), who then decrypts the rest of the SourceRouteReplyBlock, reads out the delivery instructions 
contained therein, and forwards the TunnelCreateStatusMessage accordingly.  (the delivery instructions can specify 
delivery to a specific router or can point at a tunnel)

<p>
<H2>Issues/todo</H2>

<p>
<UL>
<li> We will assign unique tunnel ids for each router in the tunnel, rather than having a single id across the whole tunnel.  this would make traffic analysis even harder</li>
<li> Get rid of the sourceRouteBlock stuff</li>
<li> Should inbound tunnels that will be used by clients ever be used for general messages (network database, etc), rather than being free for use until its allocated?</li>
<li> I2P 3.0 tunnel mixing / pooling details</li>
<li> Tunnel throttling details
