21:02:08 &lt;duck&gt; Tue Jun  8 21:02:08 UTC 2004
21:02:21 &lt;duck&gt; meeting time
21:02:33 &lt;duck&gt; writeup is at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-June/000268.html
21:02:39 &lt;duck&gt; but I did make a mistake in the numbering
21:02:45 &lt;duck&gt; so the first item 5 will be skipped
21:02:53 &lt;hypercubus&gt; yay!
21:03:03  * duck puts some ice in his beer
21:03:14  * mihi 'd rename first #5 to #4 ;)
21:03:27 &lt;hypercubus&gt; nah, let's just have two item 4's next week ;-)
21:03:37  * duck renames 'hypercubus' to 'mihi'
21:03:48 &lt;hypercubus&gt; yay!
21:03:49 &lt;duck&gt; ok
21:03:53 &lt;duck&gt; * 1) libsam
21:04:02 &lt;duck&gt; is there a Nightblade in the channel?
21:04:39 &lt;duck&gt; (idle     : 0 days 0 hours 0 mins 58 secs)
21:05:03 &lt;hypercubus&gt; ;-)
21:05:53  * duck reclaims the microphone
21:06:15 &lt;duck&gt; Nightblade wrote a SAM lib for C / C++
21:06:23 &lt;duck&gt; it compiles for me.. but that is all I can say :)
21:06:37 &lt;mihi&gt; no test cases? ;)
21:07:06 &lt;duck&gt; if there are any rFfreebsd users Nightblade might be interested in you
21:07:08 &lt;ugha_node&gt; The strstr calls really annoyed me in the code. ;)
21:07:27 &lt;ugha_node&gt; duck: What's a rFfreebsd?
21:07:42 &lt;duck&gt; how I did type freebsd
21:08:00 &lt;mihi&gt; rm -rF freebsd?
21:08:29 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Too bad -F doesn't work with rm.
21:08:30 &lt;duck&gt; ugha_node: its bsd licensed; so fix it
21:08:41 &lt;fvw&gt; sounds sane to me :). Alas I uninstalled my last freebsd box a while back. I 
                have accounts on other peoples' boxes though, and am willing to run testcases.
21:08:43 &lt;ugha_node&gt; duck: I might. :)
21:08:50 &lt;duck&gt; (damn BSD hippies)
21:09:09 &lt;duck&gt; oh, nice and short frank
21:09:17 &lt;duck&gt; mo libsam comments?
21:09:49 &lt;duck&gt; fvw: I guess Nightblade will contact you if he has a need
21:09:50  * fvw grumbles at perfectly sane unix behaviour for killing his irc client.
21:10:02 &lt;duck&gt; but since his email was a week old be might have found something
21:10:17 &lt;mihi&gt; fvw: ?
21:10:24 &lt;fvw&gt; yeah, if someone wanted to take me up on my offer I sort of missed that. Feel 
                free to send email or something.
21:10:42  * duck hops to #2
21:10:46 &lt;hypercubus&gt; uhm, to where? ;-)
21:10:54 &lt;duck&gt; 2) browse i2p and normal web with one browser
21:10:57 &lt;fvw&gt; fresh install, haven't yet told my zsh not to hup stuff in the bacgrkground. 
                &lt;/offtopic&gt;

21:11:09 &lt;fvw&gt; hypercubus: I'm on the public mailinglist user list I think. fvw.i2p@var.cx
21:12:11 &lt;duck&gt; there was some stuff about adding all TLDs to your brower proxy ignore list
21:12:23 &lt;fvw&gt; does that require discussion? I think it was pretty much handled on the 
                mailinglist.
21:12:24 &lt;duck&gt; I think it is a dirty hack
21:12:36 &lt;fvw&gt; yes, that was mentioned. Welcome back.
21:12:47 &lt;duck&gt; fvw: I didnt read the thread :)
21:13:12 &lt;duck&gt; okay, if you dont want to discuss it, move to #3
21:13:19 &lt;duck&gt; * 3) chat channel
21:13:23 &lt;hypercubus&gt; cervantes' script works perfectly on Konqueror 3.2.2, Firefox 0.8, and 
                       Opera 7.51, all for Gentoo w/KDE 3.2.2
21:13:39  * mihi places a flag on #4
21:13:55 &lt;duck&gt; #i2p-chat is an alternative channel here for offtopic chat and light support
21:14:08 &lt;duck&gt; I dont know who did regg it
21:14:12 &lt;hypercubus&gt; i did
21:14:17 &lt;duck&gt; so better be careful :)
21:14:22 &lt;fvw&gt; ehm, there is no #4, just two #5's :)
21:14:33 &lt;hypercubus&gt; i'll be lucky if i can remember the password when i need it ;-)
21:14:33 &lt;mihi&gt; [22:27] -ChanServ-      Channel: #i2p-chat
21:14:33 &lt;mihi&gt; [22:27] -ChanServ-      Contact: hypercubus &lt;&lt;ONLINE &gt;&gt;

21:14:33 &lt;mihi&gt; [22:27] -ChanServ-    Alternate: cervantes &lt;&lt;ONLINE &gt;&gt;
21:14:37 &lt;mihi&gt; [22:27] -ChanServ-   Registered: 4 days (0h 2m 41s) ago
21:15:12 &lt;hypercubus&gt; i gave a few trusted peeps op powers for whenver i'm not around and 
                       there's trouble
21:15:24 &lt;duck&gt; sounds good
21:15:39 &lt;duck&gt; it might be a bit overkill
21:15:51 &lt;hypercubus&gt; you never know on IRC ;-)
21:15:55 &lt;duck&gt; but after this protogirl did join here I thought it would be good to clean up 
                 this chan
21:16:03 &lt;hypercubus&gt; heh
21:16:27 &lt;hypercubus&gt; we'll need it for sure sometime in the next few months anyhow
21:16:34 &lt;duck&gt; jups
21:16:48 &lt;duck&gt; and then the freenode ppl will kick us out 
21:16:55 &lt;hypercubus&gt; ;-)
21:17:13 &lt;duck&gt; they dont like anything that isnt written in their kampf
21:17:16 &lt;duck&gt; err
21:17:44  * duck moves to $nextitem and triggers mihi's breakpoint
21:17:47 &lt;hypercubus&gt; i figured tying the new channel in with support would legitimize it for 
                       freenode
21:18:47 &lt;duck&gt; hypercubus: you might be surprised
21:19:04 &lt;hypercubus&gt; *cough* i admittedly didn't read all the policies...
21:19:24 &lt;duck&gt; it is russian roullete
21:19:39 &lt;hypercubus&gt; hmm, didn't think it would be quite that dire
21:19:52  * duck is being negative
21:19:54 &lt;hypercubus&gt; well i'll look into what we can do
21:20:09 &lt;fvw&gt; sorry, I must have missed something. Why would freenode kick us off?
21:20:21  * duck looks at the timeout counter for mihi's breakpoint
21:20:32 &lt;duck&gt; fvw: they focus on development channels
21:20:35 &lt;mihi&gt; ?
21:20:53 &lt;mihi&gt; duck: the breakpoint triggers on /^4).*/
21:21:01 &lt;duck&gt; mihi: but there is no #4
21:21:06 &lt;fvw&gt; so? i2p is soo alpha that right now even support is development.
21:21:11 &lt;fvw&gt; (and no, you may not quote me on that)
21:21:36 &lt;duck&gt; fvw: you might not be familiar with the types of discussion that did happen 
                 on IIP
21:21:38 &lt;hypercubus&gt; yeah but we have *2* channels for it
21:21:45 &lt;duck&gt; and which will likely happen in #i2p channels
21:22:04 &lt;duck&gt; I am pretty sure that freenode does not appreciate it.
21:22:10 &lt;Nightblade&gt; i'm here now
21:22:49 &lt;hypercubus&gt; we'll donate a margarita machine to them or something
21:22:49 &lt;mihi&gt; duck: what do you refer to? the floods? or #cl? or what?
21:23:08 &lt;fvw&gt; discussions on IIP or discussions on #iip? I've never seen anything apart from 
                devel and support on #iip. And discussions on IIP would move to I2P, not 
                #i2p@freenode.
21:23:09 &lt;duck&gt; all kinds of non political correct talk
21:23:36 &lt;fvw&gt; there's margarita machines? Ooh, me want.
21:23:54 &lt;duck&gt; oh well
21:24:38 &lt;hypercubus&gt; shall we revisit 2)?
21:24:58 &lt;duck&gt; hypercubus: what do you have to add about the browser proxy?
21:25:18 &lt;hypercubus&gt; oops, number 1... since nightblade just graced us with his presence ;-)
21:25:33 &lt;duck&gt; Nightblade: we took the freedom to 'discuss' libsam
21:25:42 &lt;Nightblade&gt; Ok, i'll say a few lines
21:25:48 &lt;hypercubus&gt; but yeah i had something that wasn't brought up on the list about the 
                       browser thing too now that i think about it
21:25:56 &lt;duck&gt; Nightblade: fvw told us that he might be able to help with some freebsd 
                 testing
21:26:20 &lt;fvw&gt; I don't have a freebsd machine anymore but I have accounts on freebsd 
                machines, give me test cases and I'd be happy to run them.
21:27:02 &lt;Nightblade&gt; I have started working on a C++ dht, which uses Libsam (C).  At this 
                       point I have not gotten especially far although I've been working a lot 
                       on it.  right now nodes in the dht can "ping" each other through a sam 
                       data message
21:27:09 &lt;Nightblade&gt; in the process i found a couple minor bugs in libsam
21:27:18 &lt;Nightblade&gt; which i will post a new version of sometime in the future
21:27:51 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Nightblade: Could you please remove those 'strstr' calls from libsam? :)
21:27:52 &lt;Nightblade&gt; the test case is: try to compile it and report the errors to me
21:28:01 &lt;Nightblade&gt; what is wrong with strstr
21:28:21 &lt;ugha_node&gt; It's not meant to be used instead of strcmp.
21:28:38 &lt;Nightblade&gt; oh yeah, also I am going to port libsam to windows, but that is not in 
                       any near future
21:29:07 &lt;Nightblade&gt; is there anything wrong with the way i am using it, besides aesthetics?
21:29:15 &lt;Nightblade&gt; you can send me changes or tell me what you'd rather do
21:29:19 &lt;Nightblade&gt; that just seemed the easiest way
21:29:21 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Nightblade: I didn't notice any.
21:29:32 &lt;fvw&gt; strcmp is more efficient than strstr ofcourse.
21:29:36 &lt;ugha_node&gt; But I just skimmed through it.
21:30:20 &lt;ugha_node&gt; fvw: You can occasionally exploit stuff which uses strstr instead of 
                      strcmp, but that's not the case.
21:31:22 &lt;Nightblade&gt; yeah now i see some places where i can change it
21:31:28 &lt;fvw&gt; that too, but I'm assuming you'd have noted that. Well, actually, you'd have 
                to use strncmp to prevent those exploits. But that's besides the point.
21:31:31 &lt;Nightblade&gt; i don't remember why i did it that way
21:31:57 &lt;ugha_node&gt; fvw: I agree.
21:32:27 &lt;Nightblade&gt; oh now i remember why
21:32:40 &lt;Nightblade&gt; it is a lazy way of not having to figure the length for strncmp
21:32:49 &lt;duck&gt; heh
21:32:52 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Nightblade: Heheh.
21:33:01 &lt;fvw&gt; use min(strlen(foo), sizeof(*foo))
21:33:04 &lt;hypercubus&gt; shall the spanking commence?
21:33:15 &lt;fvw&gt; I thought the oral sex came first? *ducks*
21:33:32 &lt;fvw&gt; right, next point I think. Hypercube had a comment about proxying?
21:33:38 &lt;hypercubus&gt; heh
21:33:54 &lt;duck&gt; bring it on!
21:34:03 &lt;Nightblade&gt; i will make the changes for the next version - change some of them at 
                       least
21:34:25 &lt;hypercubus&gt; ok, well this had been discussed briefly in channel a few weeks back, 
                       but i think it bears revisiting
21:34:48 &lt;deer&gt; * Sugadude volunteers to perform the oral sex.
21:34:59 &lt;hypercubus&gt; rather than adding TLD's to your browser's block list, or using the 
                       proxy script, there's a third way
21:35:29 &lt;hypercubus&gt; which shouldn't have the same drawbacks as the other two approaches 
                       anonymity-wise
21:36:17 &lt;fvw&gt; which I'll tell you for the cheap cheap price of $29.99? Spill it already!
21:36:27 &lt;hypercubus&gt; and that would be to have the eeproxy re-write incoming html pages to 
                       embed the page in a frameset... 
21:36:58 &lt;hypercubus&gt; the main frame would contain the requested HTTP content, the other 
                       frame would serve as a control bar
21:37:13 &lt;hypercubus&gt; and would allow you to turn on/off proxying at will
21:37:40 &lt;hypercubus&gt; and will also alert you, perhaps via colored borders or some other kind 
                       of alert, that you're browsing non-anonymously
21:37:54 &lt;fvw&gt; how are you going to prevent an i2p site (with javascript etc) from turning 
                off anonimity?
21:37:59  * duck tries to apply jrandom-skill-level-of tolerance
21:37:59 &lt;hypercubus&gt; or that a link in an eepsite page leads to the RealWeb(tm)
21:38:04 &lt;duck&gt; cool! make it!
21:38:16 &lt;fvw&gt; you'll still have to do something fproxy-like, or make something 
                non-browser-controlled for switching.
21:38:29 &lt;ugha_node&gt; fvw: Right.
21:39:10 &lt;hypercubus&gt; that's why i'm throwing this out here again, perhaps someone might have
                        some ideas about how to secure this
21:39:31 &lt;hypercubus&gt; but imo this is something that will be sorely needed for most i2p end 
                       usrers
21:39:33 &lt;hypercubus&gt; *users
21:40:04 &lt;hypercubus&gt; because the TLD/proxy script/dedicated browser approaches are too much 
                       to ask of your general net user
21:40:29 &lt;fvw&gt; In the long run, I think an fproxy workalike is the best idea. But that's 
                definately not a priority imho, and I don't actually think browsing sites will 
                be the i2p killer app.
21:40:42 &lt;Sonium&gt; What is the netDb anyway?
21:40:59 &lt;duck&gt; Sonium: database of known routers
21:41:10 &lt;hypercubus&gt; fproxy is too cumbersome for most users
21:41:32 &lt;Sonium&gt; doesn't such a database compromise annonymity?
21:41:39 &lt;hypercubus&gt; imo it's part of the reason freenet never caught on in the non-dev 
                       community
21:41:41 &lt;fvw&gt; hypercube: not necessarily. proxy autoconfiguragion ("pac") can make it as 
                simple as filling in a single value in your browser config. I think we 
                shouldn't underestimate the fact that in the foreseeable future, all the i2p 
                users will be at least slightly clueful computer-wise. (all evidence on 
                freenet-support notwithstanding)
21:42:00 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Sonium: No, 'bad guys' could collect that information manually anyway.
21:42:21 &lt;Sonium&gt; but if NetDb is down i2p is down, right?
21:42:29 &lt;fvw&gt; hypercubus: Not really, I think the fact that it hasn't worked at all since 
                early 0.5 is more to blame for that. &lt;/offtopic time="once again"&gt;

21:42:44 &lt;fvw&gt; Sonium: you can have more than one netdb (anyone can run one)
21:42:58 &lt;hypercubus&gt; we already have pac, and even though it works spectacularly from a tech 
                       standpoint, realistically it's not going to protect the anonymity of 
                       the avg. jog
21:43:03 &lt;hypercubus&gt; *avg. joe
21:43:22 &lt;ugha_node&gt; fvw: Err.. Every router has its own netDb.
21:43:42 &lt;duck&gt; ok. I am about to pass out. be sure to *baff* the meeting closed after you 
                 are done
21:43:52 &lt;ugha_node&gt; I2P has no central dependencies anymore.
21:44:07 &lt;hypercubus&gt; ok, well i just wanted to get this idea formally in the logs ;-)
21:44:30 &lt;fvw&gt; ugha_node: ok, a published netdb then. I don't actually run a node (yet), I'm 
                not entirely up with the terminology.
21:44:34 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Hmm. Didn't mihi want to say something?
21:45:05  * fvw feeds duck coffee-flavoured chocolate to keep him up and running a little bit 
          longer.
21:45:07 &lt;mihi&gt; no :)
21:45:21 &lt;mihi&gt; is duck a network device? ;)
21:45:25 &lt;ugha_node&gt; mihi: Btw, are you going to take the window size increase bounty?
21:45:28  * fvw feeds duck alcohol-flavoured chocolate to shut him down indefinately.
21:45:30 &lt;hypercubus&gt; in swedish
21:45:52 &lt;mihi&gt; ugha_node: what bounty?
21:46:00 &lt;hypercubus&gt; okay, then on to 5), rant-a-rama? ;-)
21:46:13 &lt;ugha_node&gt; mihi: http://www.i2p.net/node/view/224
21:46:27  * duck eats some of fvw's chocolate
21:47:16 &lt;mihi&gt; ugha_node: definitely no; sorry
21:47:36 &lt;ugha_node&gt; mihi: Uh, okay. :(
21:48:33  * mihi tried to hack up the "old" streaming api some time ago, but that one was too 
          buggy...
21:48:53 &lt;mihi&gt; but it would imho be easier to fix that one instead of fixing mine...
21:49:21 &lt;ugha_node&gt; Heh.
21:49:42 &lt;hypercubus&gt; so modest
21:49:46 &lt;mihi&gt; since it already has some (broken) "reordering" support in it
21:50:49 &lt;Sonium&gt; is there a way to ask deer how many people are on the i2p-#i2p channel?
21:51:01 &lt;duck&gt; no
21:51:08 &lt;hypercubus&gt; nope, but i can add that to bogobot
21:51:08 &lt;Sonium&gt; :/
21:51:11 &lt;Nightblade&gt; !list
21:51:13 &lt;deer&gt; &lt;duck&gt; 10 ppl
21:51:13 &lt;hypercubus&gt; after i finish the installer ;-)
21:51:24 &lt;Sonium&gt; !list
21:51:32 &lt;Sonium&gt; o_O
21:51:35 &lt;mihi&gt; Sonium ;)
21:51:38 &lt;ugha_node&gt; This is not an fserv channel!
21:51:39 &lt;Sonium&gt; that was a trick!
21:51:40 &lt;ugha_node&gt; :)
21:51:41 &lt;hypercubus&gt; should be !who
21:51:44 &lt;deer&gt; &lt;duck&gt; ant duck identiguy Pseudonym ugha2p bogobot hirvox jrandom Sugadude 
                 unknown
21:51:48 &lt;cervantes&gt; oop missed the meeting

21:52:50 &lt;hypercubus&gt; i sense a gavel coming down
21:52:51 &lt;duck&gt; sounds like a good time to close it down
21:52:55 &lt;Sonium&gt; btw, you should also implement an !8 command like chanserv has
21:52:59 &lt;fvw&gt; right, now we have that settled, let's clo.. yes. that.
21:53:00  * hypercubus is psychic
21:53:05 &lt;duck&gt; *BAFF*
21:53:11 &lt;Nightblade&gt; !baff
