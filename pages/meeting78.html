Considering we did not have a very official meeting do to Jrand0m not
feeling very well, here are my logs of the meeting from slightly
before it started to sometime after it ended.  I have edited out the
kick offs and start screens from iip restarting at least twice during
that period.  If someone else has better logs feel free to replace
these. (baffled)
<p>
&lt;human&gt; baffled: we're experimenting a psychic communication towards jrand0m, to ask him to be here for the meeting
&lt;human&gt; baffled: just focus your mind on him, and help us
&gt; Don't we have to hold hands or something like that?
&lt;human&gt; baffled: if it helps you focusing your mind... well, yes
&gt; Cool, gimme your hand I'm commensing to focus!

<li> human gives his hand to baffled

human has changed the topic on channel #i2p to I2P meeting: hold the hand of your neighbour, focus your mind on jrand0m, and ask him to come here

&lt;wilde&gt; let's make an agenda ourselves

<li> human will direct the meeting in exchange of the sacrifice of the first daughter of every participant

&lt;wilde&gt; funding, strategy, marketing, website, recruiting more developers and powerusers, etc
&lt;human&gt; wilde: i agree, we could informally talk about the recent history of I2P
&lt;DrWoo<a href="iip-wiki?action=edit&id=DrWoo" class=wikipageedit>?</a>&gt; wilde: open a text window and quickly make a numbered agenda
<UL >
<li> human agrees with wilde

&lt;jrand0m&gt; hah nice
&lt;jrand0m&gt; perhaps we can jump into that agenda, or are we on 1, 2, 3, 6?

&lt;wilde&gt; 1. Hello
&lt;wilde&gt; Hello I2P
&lt;fidd&gt; hi
&lt;jrand0m&gt; hi
&lt;jar&gt; hi
&lt;kaji&gt; ah, i made it
&lt;wilde&gt; last hellos? going once, going twice...
&lt;kaji&gt; hi
&gt; Which agenda the one you posted or the oone wild posted?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; perhaps I can help out with agenda 2) status
&lt;wilde&gt; 2. Status I2P
&lt;jrand0m&gt; the router, as is, is nonfunctional
&lt;wilde&gt; so how are we post-testnet?
&gt; can we cote on that?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; post testnet, yes, but I introduced two bugs in the process
&gt; vote.
&lt;jrand0m&gt; vote on whether its nonfunctional?
&gt; Right.
<UL >
<li> jrand0m wonders if we vote hard enough it'll be functional again
</UL>
&lt;kaji&gt; its dead for me
&gt; oh, nevermind.
&gt; well, we held hands and you appeared.
&lt;jrand0m&gt; hey, worth a shot ;)
<UL >
<li> jrand0m starts a bug-excorcism seance
</UL>
&gt; does that make them bogobugs?
<UL >
<li> DrWoo<a href="iip-wiki?action=edit&id=DrWoo" class=wikipageedit>?</a> sprinkles dried blood on the floor
<li> jrand0m senses that this chant will cause the bugs to dissapear in the next day or two, with an email going out to i2p@ once its ready
</UL>
&gt; oh wooooow!
&lt;kaji&gt; i switched to j2sdk1.4.2_03 to get ant to work on XP, i wonder how much of and effect it has on the router not working
&lt;wilde&gt; so there's a short i2p vacation
&lt;jrand0m&gt; none, I use that build on xp
&lt;jrand0m&gt; the bug is programmer error, probably a trivial one too
&lt;jrand0m&gt; (but quite fatal)
&lt;jrand0m&gt; right wilde
&lt;jrand0m&gt; but after that, I've been making a bunch of progress on the docs for 0.2.5 and 0.3
&lt;jrand0m&gt; so I don't think they'll be a full two weeks out
&lt;jrand0m&gt; but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
&lt;wilde&gt; nice, any application improvments anyone?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; one idea - on the testnet, we focused a lot on irc and echo, more than eepsites
<UL >
<li> wilde notes in the black book who hasn't done todays homework, a cool I2P application
</UL>
&gt; Do you think they suffered for that? I certainly do.
&lt;jrand0m&gt; having lots of clients (aka destinations) on a single router increases the load, and we may want to think about trimming down our test scope, perhaps
&lt;jrand0m&gt; there's also a discussion wrt perhaps revisiting the keysize of the crypto to reduce the load (for another day after we have more metrics, etc) 
Signoff: Robert (Ping timeout)
&gt; What do you consider a lot of clients on one router?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; I dont know, I would like once 0.2.4.x is out and usable that we can use both IRC and eepsites
&lt;jrand0m&gt; that depends on the computer
&lt;wilde&gt; so what's best for now? eepsites or irc?
<UL >
<li> jrand0m wants both, and we will have both functional in the mid and long run
</UL>
&lt;jrand0m&gt; anyway, we can see as 0.2.4.x comes out.  perhaps both will be fine again.
&lt;wilde&gt; yeah but what's most useful for debugging? continous connections or sporadic ones?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; both ;)
&lt;wilde&gt; lighweight irc, or eep graphics?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; i2p needs to support long term streaming connections and short term bursty ones
&lt;kaji&gt; what about heavy long downloads?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; right, long term streaming connections
&lt;jrand0m&gt; (though I do think filesharing over i2p would best be served with i2psnark via messages, ala udp)
&lt;wilde&gt; the question really is: you suggested narrowing the test scope, was that to IRC or EEP?
&lt;wilde&gt; (or something else)
&lt;jrand0m&gt; two or three clients will be fine, I just know that running 4+ services may be a bit of an overload for the time being (depending on people's computer)
lucky (~lucky@anon.iip) has joined channel #i2p
&lt;wilde&gt; ok, that's probably wise
&lt;jrand0m&gt; anyone have any dev status for client apps?
&lt;wilde&gt; so the focus should be on services that can us some statistics, like the irc scripts
&lt;jrand0m&gt; that is definitely key.
Newsbyte (~fredisdea@anon.iip) has joined channel #i2p
&lt;jrand0m&gt; woah
&lt;jrand0m&gt; hi Newsbyte
&lt;Newsbyte&gt; ah, jran
<UL >
<li> wilde looks at the clock and at Newsbyte, late arrival, that will cost you an apple
</UL>
&lt;Newsbyte&gt; huh?
&lt;Newsbyte&gt; I never come here
&lt;jrand0m&gt; also, the echo server and client app is great at gathering stats, and doesn't have any irc-specific dependencies. 
&lt;wilde&gt; nothing
&lt;Newsbyte&gt; besides, what's an I2P meeting without nop? ;-)
&lt;DrWoo<a href="iip-wiki?action=edit&id=DrWoo" class=wikipageedit>?</a>&gt; wilde: heh somehow I dont think hes here for the meeting :)
&lt;human&gt; would an eepsite monitoring tool be useful?
&lt;Newsbyte&gt; no nop, no meeting
<UL >
<li> Newsbyte can summarise
</UL>
&lt;wilde&gt; jrand0m: is there something else you'd like to have statistics in the network?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; human&gt; certainly - perhaps some way to do periodic pings of eepsites, maybe keeping track of changes even?
&lt;human&gt; jrand0m: keeping track of what changes?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; I think with the irc scripts giving us long term disconnect / reliability stats, plus the echo app giving us latency, the only thing left is really throughput
&lt;jrand0m&gt; content on the page changing 
&lt;Newsbyte&gt; yes, and use more then one server
&lt;wilde&gt; a kb/s meter, I2P Pirate Radio someone?
&lt;jrand0m&gt; hmm?  right, when the net is up we usually have between 4-10 servers
&lt;human&gt; jrand0m: it's doable but... how would you use the content change information?
&lt;kaji&gt; i ran a shoutcast stream for a while
&lt;jrand0m&gt; human&gt; that particular aspect wouldn't help me, but would let users use the test (which would tell them whats changed, as well as get them to run the test more [generate more traffic])
&lt;jrand0m&gt; nice kaji
&lt;jrand0m&gt; yeah, aum's streams were up periodically as well
&lt;human&gt; jrand0m: oh, ok, now i understand
&lt;mihi&gt; jrand0m: a chargen service? ;)
&lt;madman2003&gt; bye everyone, good luck with i2p
&lt;wilde&gt; so throuhput is one stat that would be interesting/useful
