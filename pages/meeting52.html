&lt;nop&gt;	ok, meeting started
&lt;nop&gt;	what's on the agenda
--&gt;	logger (logger@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
--&gt;	Anon02 (~anon@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Tue Aug  5 21:03:10 UTC 2003
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Welcome to the Nth iip-dev meeting.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	What's on the agenda?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	Tue Aug  5 21:02:44 UTC 2003
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	synced to a NTP stratum 2 :)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Tue Aug  5 21:03:13 UTC 2003
--&gt;	ptm (~ptm@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Just synced to NIST. :)
&lt;mihi&gt;	this sync does not help w/ iip delays ;)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	nop: things I want to see covered: java dev status, java crypto
	  status, python dev status, sdk status, naming service
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	(We're going into the naming service _already_?)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	not design you wanker, thats co's schpeel.  just talk about stuff
	  if there's stuff to talk about.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Ah
*	jrand0m puts LART away
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	anything else on the agenda?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	or shall we dig in?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Well, I can't think of anything else to add.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Ah!
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Oh!
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok.  java dev status:
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Good.
&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (Ping timeout)
&lt;nop&gt;	ok
&lt;nop&gt;	agenda
&lt;nop&gt;	1) Welcome
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	as of today, there is a java client API with a stub java router
	  that can talk to each other.  in addition, there is an application called ATalk
	  allowing anonymous IM + file transfer.
&lt;nop&gt;	2) IIP 1.1 blackouts
&lt;nop&gt;	3) I2P
&lt;nop&gt;	4) The End with comments and stuff
*	jrand0m goes back to corner
&lt;nop&gt;	sorry
	  joeyo jrand0m Aug 05 17:08:24 * hezekiah gives jrand0m a dunce hat to wear in
	  the corner. ;-)
&lt;nop&gt;	sorry about that
&lt;nop&gt;	didn't see you started there
&lt;nop&gt;	maybe I should go in corner
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	no worry.  item 1)
*	hezekiah hands nop a dunce hat too. :)
&lt;nop&gt;	ok welcome everybuddy
&lt;nop&gt;	blah blah
&lt;nop&gt;	2) IIP 1.1 blackouts
--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	52nd iip-dev meeting and all that good rot!
&lt;nop&gt;	the server recently had some issues with the hard drive sectors and has
	  been replaced
&lt;nop&gt;	I plan to be moving the darn server into a more stable environment with
	  redundancy
&lt;nop&gt;	and possibly lend out control of multiple ircd servers
&lt;nop&gt;	dunno
&lt;nop&gt;	that's something to be discussed
&lt;--	Anon02 has quit (EOF From client)
&lt;nop&gt;	hopefully our servers should stay up now since the harddrive was replaced
&lt;nop&gt;	sorry about the inconvenience folks
&lt;nop&gt;	3) I2P - Jrand0m take it away
&lt;nop&gt;	come out of the corner jrand0m
*	hezekiah goes over to the corner, pulls jrand0m off his chair, drags him
	  to the podium, takes away his dunce hat, and hands him the mic.
*	nop goes into that corner to fill his place
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol!
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sorry, back
*	nop grabs dunce hat from hezekiah
*	nop puts it on his head
*	nop applauds for jrand0m
*	jrand0m just watches the show
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	er... um ok
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: i2p, java status, etc. Talk man!
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so, as of today, there is a java client API with a stub java
	  router that can talk to each other.  in addition, there is an application called
	  ATalk allowing anonymous IM + file transfer.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	File transfer already!?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	si sr
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Wow.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm sure behind the times.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	but not the most graceful
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	it takes a file and tosses it in a message
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Ouch.
&lt;nop&gt;	how long did 1.8 mb local transfer take?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I've tested with a 4K file and a 1.8Mb file
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	a few seconds
&lt;nop&gt;	nice
&lt;nop&gt;	:)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Does the java stuff do real encryption yet, or does it still
	  fake that?
&lt;nop&gt;	fake
&lt;nop&gt;	even I know that
&lt;nop&gt;	:)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I warmed it up by talking to myself first [e.g. one window to
	  another, saying hi] so it didn't deal with the overhead of the first elg
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	right, its faked largely
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	most of the encryption is fake
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	that's being worked on though
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Of course. :)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	definitely.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	on that front, wanna give us an update thecrypto?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	well, right now i'm done with ElGamal and SHA256
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	right now I'm working on generating primes for DSA
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	I'll send out 5 and then we can just pick one
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: Didn't you have prime(s) coming for use with DSA?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	We also have some benchmarks on ElGamal and SHA256
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	And they are all fast
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	latest benchmarks w/ elg:
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Key Generation Time Average: 4437	total: 443759	min:
	  872	   max: 21110	   Keygen/second: 0
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Encryption Time Average    : 356	total: 35657	min:
	  431	   max: 611	   Encryption Bps: 179
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Decryption Time Average    : 983	total: 98347	min:
	  881	   max: 2143	   Decryption Bps: 65

&lt;hezekiah&gt;	min and max: are they in seconds?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	note that the Bps isn't really useful, as we only encrypt/decrypt
	  64 bytes
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	ms
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	no, sorry, those are all milliseconds
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Cool. :)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	And this is done in java?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	yes
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	pure java
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK. I am officiall impressed. :)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	100%.  P4 1.8
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	they are about the same on my 800 Mhz
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	How can I do the same tests?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sha256 benchmark:
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Short Message Time Average  : 0 total: 0	min: 0	max:
	  0  Bps: NaN
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Medium Message Time Average : 1 total: 130	min: 0	max:
	  10 Bps: 7876923
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	Long Message Time Average   : 146	total: 14641	min:
	  130	   max: 270	   Bps: 83037
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	run the ElGamalBench program
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'll go find it.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(short size: ~10 bytes, medium ~10KB, long ~ 1MB)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	java -cp i2p.jar ElGamalBench
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(after running "ant all")
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: Thanks. :)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	np
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	The NaN thing means it's so fast that we end up dividing by 0
	  it's so fast :)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	What's the sha bench?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	java -cp i2p.jar SHA256Bench
--&gt;	Neo (anon@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	we'll probably want to move those to be main() methods of the
	  associated engines, but they're good where they are atm
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Let's see how fast all this is on an AMD K6-2 333MHz (which is
	  a chip not well know for its integer math.)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	heh
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok so we have DSA and AES left, right?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	this is all wikked thecrypto.  nice work.
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	yup
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	can I nag you for an ETA on the other two?  ;)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	If this is anywhere near as fast on my box as it is on yours,
	  you have to show me how you do that. ;-)
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	DSA should be done almost as soon as i have primes ready
&lt;nop&gt;	hezekiah have you tried the sslcrypto for python
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	copying some code around from the prime generator and things like
	  that and it's done
&lt;nop&gt;	the one off that link
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: sslcrypto won't do us any good.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: It doesn't implment ElGamal _or_ AES _or_ sha256.
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	AES is mostly done except that there is some error somewhere that
	  i'm still trying to pick out and destroy, once i have that, it'll be done
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	thecrypto&gt; so by friday, DSA keygen, sign, verify, and AES encrypt,
	  decrypt for arbitrary size inputs?
&lt;nop&gt;	the one on McNab's site does not?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	yeah
&lt;nop&gt;	darn
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	should be friday
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	most likey thursday
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	thecrypto&gt; does that include the UnsignedBigInteger stuff?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i'll be missing next weeks meeting because of summer camp, and
	  i'll be back after that
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	jrand0m: prolly not
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so for the time being, interoperability between java and python
	  is b0rked.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	for crypto, that is.
---	Notify: jeremiah is online (anon.iip).
--&gt;	jeremiah (~chatzilla@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(aka for signatures, keys, encryption, and decryption)

&lt;nop&gt;	hmm maybe we should focus more on C/C++
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	well, once we get it working completely we can then make sure
	  both java and python can speak to each other
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	while you're out I'll look into the unsigned stuff.
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	can someone email me a backlog? jeremiah@kingprimate.com
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: Give me a minute. :)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	nop&gt; do we have devs for C/C++?
&lt;nop&gt;	I have one guy yes
&lt;nop&gt;	and Hezekiah we know could do it
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	or perhaps we can get a python dev status update from hezekiah +
	  jeremiah to see when we'll have more people for the c/c++ dev
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	right, of course.  but hez+jeremiah are working on python atm
	  (right?)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Yeah.
&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (Ping timeout)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm sort of giving poor jeremiah lots of trouble.
&lt;nop&gt;	I was just saying if python won't be fast speeds
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Python is mainly for me to understand this network.
&lt;nop&gt;	ahh
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Once, I get it to basically follow the complete spec, I intend
	  to hand it off to jeremiah to do with as he sees fit.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	It's not meant to be a killer implementation of the spec.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	(If I wanted that, I'd use C++.)
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	well there aren't any really processor intensive parts of the app,
	  iirc, aside from crypto, and ideally that will be handled in C anyways, right?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sure jeremiah.	all depends on the app
--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: In theory.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so where are we on the python side?  client api, local only
	  router, etc?
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	the python implementation will also let us know what optimizations
	  we could make from the start... I'd like to keep it up to date or, possibly,
	  ahead of the C implementation as I can
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: OK. Here's what I've got.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	In _theory_ the router should be able to handle all non-admin
	  messages from a client.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	However, I don't have client yet, so I haven't been able to debug
	  it (i.e. there are still bugs.)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm working on the client right now.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	'k.  if you can disable signature verification, we should be able
	  to run the java client against it now
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm hoping to have that done except for admin messages in a day
	  or two.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	we can test that out after the meeting
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: OK.
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	I've been dealing with real-world stuff mostly since the last
	  meeting, I can work on the client API, just been trying to sync my thinking
	  with hezekiah's
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	cool
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: You know what, just wait.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: I'm probably throwing in too much new stuff for you to
	  deal with right now.
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	hezekiah: right, what I was going to say is that you should
	  probably just go ahead and implement the base stuff
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: In a little while, it will be stabalized and you can
	  start refining it. (There are lots of TODO comments that need help.)
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	and then I can extend it later once I get the picture
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Exactly.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	You get to maintain all this code. :)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	cool.  so eta 1-2 weeks for a working python router + client api?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm going on vacation next week so probably.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Are we going to have more details on router to router soon?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	no.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	well, yes.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	but no.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	lol
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	hezekiah: how long is the vacation?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	1 week.
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	ok
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(aka as soon as the SDK goes out, 100% of my time goes into I2NP)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I'm hoping to have all non-admin functionality written before I
	  go on vacation
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	but then soon after you get back you're off to college, right?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I2NP?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Right.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	network proto
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I have about 1 week after vacation.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Then I'm gone.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	And my free time drops like a stone.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so that 1 week should only be debugging
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	I can work on the code while hez is gone though
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	word
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	whats your summer look like jeremiah?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: Perhaps you can get those admin functions working?

&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i'll still have a month after i come back from my vaction to work
	  on things
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	having a life, or being like the rest of us l00sers?  :)
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	maybe
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	100sers?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	What's a 100ser?
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	i leave for college on the 22nd, other than that I can dev
&lt;mihi&gt;	hezekiah: a loser
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	and the last week before I leave all my friends will be gone... so
	  I can go into hyperdev mode
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	mihi: Ah!
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	hehe
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK. So where were we on the agenda?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	i.e. What's next?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sdk status
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	sdk == one client impl, a local only router impl, an app, and docs.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I'd like to have that out by next tuesday.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jeremiah: That backlog is on the way. Sorry I forgot you there. :)
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	thanks
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok, co isn't around, so the naming service stuff is prolly a bit
	  off base
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	we can discuss the naming service after he puts out specs or
	  he's around
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok, thats it for I2P stuff
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	anyone else have I2P stuff, or we on to: &lt;nop&gt; 4) The End with
	  comments and stuff
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	I can't think of anything.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	I assume everyone's seen
	  http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/08/05/anarchist.prison.ap/index.html ?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	not here
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	(nop posted it here earlier)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	The thing about the guy who got arrested for linking to a bomb
	  building site?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	yes
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	relevence to the need to get I2P up ASAP should be aparent ;)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK! jeremiah, those logs are now sent.
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	thanks
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	anyone have any questions / comments / thoughts / frisbees,
	  or are we having a record breaking short meeting?
*	thecrypto tosses a frisbee
&lt;--	logger has quit (Ping timeout)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	damn y'all are quiet today ;)
&lt;mihi&gt;	question:
&lt;mihi&gt;	where can non devs get yout java code?
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	si sr?
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	not yet
&lt;mihi&gt;	404
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	that'll be made available once we're release ready.  aka the
	  source will go out with the SDK
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	heh
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	yeah, we don't use SF
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nop: Is it possible that we can get anonymous cvs working some tiem?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	time?
&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (Ping timeout)
&lt;nop&gt;	well, I would open up a non-standard port
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	hezekiah&gt; we'll have that once the code has the GPL license on there
&lt;nop&gt;	but I am working on viewcvs
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	aka not now since the gpl doc hasn't been added to the code yet
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	jrand0m: It's in all the python code directories and all python
	  source files speceify licensing under GPL-2.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	hezekiah&gt; is that on the cathedral?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Yes.
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ah word.  i2p/core/code/python ?  or a different module?
*	jrand0m hasn't seen it in there
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Each python code directory has a COPYING file in it with the
	  GPL-2 and each source file has the license set a GPL-2
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	It's i2p/router/python and i2p/api/python
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	'k
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	so, yeah, by next tuesday we'll have the SDK + public source access.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Cool.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Or as you like to say, wikked. ;-)
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	heh
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	nada mas?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	nada mas? What's that mean!?
&lt;jeremiah&gt;	nothing more
*	jrand0m suggests you learn a lil espanol en universidad
--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Questions anyone?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Going once!
&lt;--	ptm (~ptm@anon.iip) has left #iip-dev (ptm)
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Going twice!
&lt;--	mrflibble has quit (mr. flibble says "game over boys")
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Speak now .. or wait until you feel like speaking later!
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	okay, i'm going to be optimizing the elgamal even more, so expect
	  even faster elgamal benches in the future
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	please focus on DSA and AES before tuning... puhleeeease :)
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i will
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	The reason he's doing that is 'cause I'm causing trouble for
	  people again. ;-)
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	i'm making DSA primes
--&gt;	mrflibble (mrflibble@anon.iip) has joined #iip-dev
&lt;thecrypto&gt;	well, at least making the program to make DSA primes right now
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	ElGamal in Java doesn't like an AMD K-6 II 333MHz.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	OK.
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	Question round is over!
&lt;jrand0m&gt;	ok hez, we're done.  you wanna powow on getting the java client
	  and the python router work?
&lt;hezekiah&gt;	See you all next week citizens!
