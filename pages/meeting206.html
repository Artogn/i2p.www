<p>16:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; 3) ???</p>
<p>16:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; 0) hi</p>
<p>16:01  * jrandom waves</p>
<p>16:01 &lt; jrandom&gt; the brief weekly status notes are posted up at http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2007-April/001343.html</p>
<p>16:01  * mrflibble waves back</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; as those notes are short enough, lets jump on in to 1) Net status</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; things seem to be going along fairly well lately</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; atm there aren't any major changes underway for the net (that i know of), so that will likely remain the case</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jadeSerpent&gt; irc seems to have calmed down finally too</p>
<p>16:03 &lt; jrandom&gt; cool</p>
<p>16:05 &lt; jrandom&gt; i don't have much to add re: 1) net status, so unless anyone has anything for it, lets jump on over to 2) Syndie dev status</p>
<p>16:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; the next rev is taking longer than expected, but i'm hoping to get a new release out in the next 2-3 days</p>
<p>16:07 &lt; jrandom&gt; it won't be the desktop gui, but will include a number of improvements</p>
<p>16:08 &lt; Complication&gt; anything which helps syndication reliability would be wonderful</p>
<p>16:08 &lt; Complication&gt; it's been comparatively poor lately</p>
<p>16:08 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, that trouble should be easy enough to sort out (to an extent)</p>
<p>16:09 &lt; jadeSerpent&gt; you know what's causing the failed fetches via i2p?</p>
<p>16:09 &lt; jrandom&gt; aye, low timeouts</p>
<p>16:10 &lt; jrandom&gt; (and low handler threads on the servers)</p>
<p>16:13 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, if there isn't anything else on 2) Syndie dev status, lets jump over to 3) ???</p>
<p>16:13 &lt; jrandom&gt; anyone have anything else to bring up for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:14  * mrflibble waves</p>
<p>16:14 &lt; mrflibble&gt; sorry, going back  to  point 1 again</p>
<p>16:15 &lt; mrflibble&gt; &lt;jadeSerpent&gt; irc seems to have calmed down finally too - is this for any particular reason do you think?</p>
<p>16:16 &lt; jrandom&gt; there were some network and hardware trouble on the irc servers, and most people have upgraded to the latest release now (giving us the benefit of zzz's improvements)</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; jrandom&gt; the #s for tunnel creation success rates look much better</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; mrflibble&gt; oh ok, was the servers themselves</p>
<p>16:17 &lt; mrflibble&gt; what were zzz's imporvements?</p>
<p>16:19 &lt; Complication&gt; message priorities, to allow tunnel build messages to take priority over tunnel traffic</p>
<p>16:19 &lt; Complication&gt; and streaming lib adjustments, and the usual array of I2PSnark fixes</p>
<p>16:19 &lt; mrflibble&gt; ah,  thanks</p>
<p>16:19 &lt; jrandom&gt; (what Complication said :)</p>
<p>16:22 &lt; jrandom&gt; ok, anyone have anything else for the meeting?</p>
<p>16:26 &lt; jrandom&gt; if not</p>
<p>16:26  * jrandom winds up</p>
<p>16:26  * jrandom *baf*s the meeting closed</p>
