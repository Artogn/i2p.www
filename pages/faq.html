<h3 id="remote_webconsole">How can I access the web console from my other machines or password protect it?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#remote_webconsole">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
    For security purposes, the router's admin console by default only listens
    for connections on the local interface.  However, with a little hacking,
    you can make it reachable remotely:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up clients.config and replace<br />
    <code>clientApp.0.args=7657 127.0.0.1 ./webapps/</code><br />
    with <br />
    <code>clientApp.0.args=7657 0.0.0.0 ./webapps/</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp">http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp</a>
    and add a new option: <code>consolePassword=foo</code> (or whatever password you want)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:7657/index.jsp">http://localhost:7657/index.jsp</a>
    and hit "Graceful restart", which restarts the JVM and reloads the client applications</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After that fires up, you should now be able to reach your console remotely.
    You will be prompted for a username and password though - the username is
    "admin" and the password is whatever you specified in step 2 above.  Note: the
    <code>0.0.0.0</code> above specifies an <i>interface</i>, not a network or netmask.  0.0.0.0
    means "bind to all interfaces", so it can be reachable on 127.0.0.1:7657 as well as
    any LAN/WAN IP.

<h3 id="eepsite">Whats an "eepsite"?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#eepsite">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
	An eepsite is a website that is hosted anonymously - you can access it by
	setting your web browser's HTTP proxy to use the web proxy (typically it
	listens on localhost port 4444), and browsing to the site.
</p>

<h3 id="active">What do the Active x/y numbers mean in the router console?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#active">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
    x is the number of peers you've sent or received a message from
    successfully in the last minute, y is the number of peers seen in the last
    hour or so.

<h3 id="socks">Is it possible to use I2P as a socks proxy?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#socks">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
    While it would be technically feasible, many applications leak sensitive
    information that could identify you on the internet. I2P only filters
    connexion data, but if the programme you intend to run sends this
    information as content, I2P has no way to protect your anonymity.  For
    example, some mail applications will send the IP address of the machine
    they are running on to a mail server. There is no way for I2P to filter
    this, thus using I2P to 'socksify' existing applications is possible, but
    extremely dangerous.
</p>

<h3 id="ports">What ports does I2P use?
<span class="permalink">(<a href="#ports">link</a>)</span></h3>
<p>
	Ok, here's a rundown of the default ports (everything is configurable
	through various settings, of course):
</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Outbound UDP from port 8887 to arbitrary remote UDP ports, allowing replies</b></li>
	<li><b>(optional, but recommended) Inbound UDP to port 8887 from arbitrary locations</b></li>
	<li><b>Outbound UDP on port 123, allowing replies</b><br />
		This is necessary for I2P's internal time sync (via SNTP - 
		querying a random SNTP host in pool.ntp.org or another
		server you specify)</li>
	<li><b>Local I2P ports: </b><ul>
	  	<li><b>7654:</b> I2P Client Protocol port, used by client apps</li>
    		<li><b>7656:</b> SAM bridge, a higher level socket API for clients</li>
      		<li><b>7657:</b> your router console</li>
		<li><b>7658:</b> your eepsite</li>
  		<li><b>32000:</b> local control channel for the service wrapper</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>Default I2PTunnel ports:</b><ul>
	      	<li><b>2401:</b> cvs.i2p (disabled by default)</li>
	    	<li><b>4444:</b> HTTP proxy</li>
		<li><b>6668:</b> round robin across the irc2p IRC network</li>
		<li><b>7659:</b> smtp.postman.i2p</li>
		<li><b>7660:</b> pop.postman.i2p</li></ul></li>
	</ul>
		      
<p>
	The local I2P ports and the I2PTunnel ports do not need to be reachable from 
	remote machines, but *should* be reachable locally.  You can also create 
	additional ports for I2PTunnel instances via http://localhost:7657/i2ptunnel/ 
	(and in turn, would need to get your firewall to allow you local access, but 
	not remote access, unless desired).
</p>

<p>
	So, to summarize, nothing needs to be reachable by unsolicted remote peers, but
	if you can configure your NAT/firewall to allow inbound UDP to port 8887, you'll
	get better performance.  You will also need to be able to send outbound UDP packets
	to arbitrary remote peers (blocking IPs randomly with something like PeerGuardian
	only hurts you - don't do it).

    the <a href="http://forum.i2p.net/">forum</a> and we'll post it here (with
    the answer, hopefully).
