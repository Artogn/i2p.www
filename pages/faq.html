<h3>What is I2P?</h3>
<p>
	I2P is a generic anonymous and secure peer to peer communication layer. It is
	a network that sits on top of another network (in this case, it sits on top of
	the internet). It is responsible for delivering a message anonymously and
	securely to another location.  We have both a more detailed 
        <a href="about">summary</a> and more in depth <a href="how">tech info</a>
        available.
</p>

<h3>How can I access the web console from my other machines?</h3>
<p>For security purposes, the router's admin console by default only listens for 
connections on the local interface.  However, with a little hacking, you can make
it reachable remotely:</p><ol>
<li>Open up clients.config and replace<br />
    <code>clientApp.0.args=7657 127.0.0.1 ./webapps/</code><br />
    with <br />
    <code>clientApp.0.args=7657 0.0.0.0 ./webapps/</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp">http://localhost:7657/configadvanced.jsp</a>
    and add a new option: <code>consolePassword=foo</code> (or whatever password you want)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:7657/configservice.jsp">http://localhost:7657/configservice.jsp</a>
    and hit "Hard restart", which restarts the JVM and reloads the client applications</li>
</ol>

<p>After that fires up, you should now be able to reach your console remotely.  You
will be prompted for a username and password though - the username is "admin" and the
password is whatever you specified in step 2 above.</p>

<h3>How does it scale?</h3>

For now, we'll answer that question in three parts:
<ul>
 <li>End to end communication consumes O(1) resources (bandwidth, CPU, etc).
     More specifically, the load on the network (bytes transferred) is
     <code>Bm*(Hi+Ho+1)</code>.  Note that the size of the network (N) does
     not come into play at any time.<ul>
      <li><i>Bm</i>: number of bytes in a message</li>
      <li><i>Hi</i>: number of hops in the target's inbound tunnel</li>
      <li><i>Ho</i>: number of hops in the source's outbound tunnel</li>
     </ul></li>
 <li>Network database operation and maintenance consumes O(log(N)) resources
     (where N = number of peers in the network).  This is derived from the
     <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/529075.html">Kademlia</a> base.</li>
 <li>For engineering reasons, the I2P implementation is not yet able to handle 
     operation in a large network.  This is bound at the moment by threading 
     issues associated with our current TCP transport.  The 
     <a href="roadmap">0.4.2 and 0.4.3</a> releases should address this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Whats an "eepsite"?</h3>
<p>
	An eepsite is a website that is hosted anonymously - you can access it by
	setting your web browser's HTTP proxy to use the web proxy (typically it
	listens on localhost port 4444), and browsing to the site.
</p>

<h3>Can I browse the web with I2P?</h3>
<p>
	Yes - the I2PTunnel eepproxy includes a hook to use an anonymously hosted
	outbound proxy (squid.i2p).  If you have your browser set to use the web
	proxy, if you type http://google.com/ your request will be routed through I2P
	to the outbound proxy.
</p>

<h3>How anonymous is I2P anyway?</h3>
<p>
	I2P is working to support militant grade anonymity, <b>but we're not there
	yet</b>.  You should not use I2P if you <i>need</i> your anonymity - there are
	likely bugs and perhaps other issues, and it has not gone through sufficient
	peer review.  However, we're confident that we'll get to the point that we can
	provide anonymity strong enough even for militantly subversive political
	action (so it should be fine for you to chat online with your friends)
</p>
<p>
	An important point to note is that I2P does <b>not</b> provide anonymity or
	security of content after it is transferred - you can still download and run a
	virus, or even submit your full name and bank account numbers on an eepsite.
	I2P only tries to provide communication security and anonymity - what you say
	or do is up to you.
</p>

<h3>How does I2P protect itself from denial of service attacks?</h3>
<p>
	For this too, there are several answers. Short summary is "the best it can".  
	Briefly, I2P attempts to defend against several forms of denial of service 
	attack, all without centralized coordination. For applications using I2P, 
	the computer they are located on is not exposed to the public, so the 
	standard denial of service attack cannot be directly mounted against them
	(ala ping floods, etc). Instead, attackers are forced to go after the 
	gateways to that application's inbound tunnels - of which there can be many
	at any given time. Each gateway also has its own limits for how many messages
	and/or bytes it agrees to send down the tunnel. The application itself 
	periodically tests these tunnels to make sure they're still reachable and 
	usable, so if one of them is taken out by an IP level attack of any kind,
	it will know and rebuild its leases, specifying new gateways.  
</p>
<p>
	To prevent individual users from consuming excessive resources (registering
	too many tunnels, sending too many messages, looking up too many entries in
	the network database, and creating too many router and destination
	identities), various messages and identities have a certificate attached to
	them.  Currently these certificates are blank, but down the line they will be
	filled with
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">HashCash</a>
	- a computationally expensive collision based on the contents of the
	message or identity.  They can also be filled with other certificates as
	deemed necessary (e.g. a blinded certificate from an anonymous certificate
	authority, a receipt for real currency payments, etc).  It is also believed
	that through this certificate attachment system I2P will be able to overcome
	the <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/douceur02sybil.html">sybil attack</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Other denial of service attacks include creating a few thousand high quality 
	I2P routers, running them for a week, and then taking them all offline.  This 
	indeed may force the creation of islands within the network, but the
	underlying <a href="how_networkdatabase">Network Database</a> is built off of
	a modified <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/529075.html">Kademlia</a>,
	which should allow the network to recover with minimal overhead (though, of
	course, if a router has literally no other peers left after the bad ones
	leave, that router will need to 'reseed' - fetch a reference to another router
	through some other mechanism).
</p>

<h3>What about greedy users?  Won't there be a tragedy of the commons?</h3>
<p>Quoting a <a href="http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-August/000400.html">recent
discussion</a> on the mailing list:</p>
<pre>
&gt; Now for this ultra-greedy user, it's irrational
&gt; to allocate downstream bandwidth for anything other
&gt; than his current huge Bittorrent download.  So he
&gt; uses 99% of his bandwidth for his own tunnels, and
&gt; 1% of his bandwidth for everyone else's tunnels.

&gt; It will become a practical issue because people will
&gt; write "I2P download optimizers," which will abuse the
&gt; network in exactly this way.

Here, I'll write the optimal download optimizer for them.
Turn
 java -jar i2ptunnel.jar
into
 java -Dtunnels.depthInbound=0 -jar i2ptunnel.jar

voila.  The data they receive goes through no other routers,
allowing them to get obscene transfer rates (but not wire
speed, since we /do/ have some overhead :).  They still do
have some level of anonymity, since no one else knows their
tunnels are 0 hops long (at least, not without statistical
analysis or some powerful traffic analysis).  This is
probably (IANAL) sufficient "plausible deniability" for
many people (the RIAA/MPAA won't get the court orders to
mount the necessary traffic analysis, though the NSA
wouldn't bother)

The load on the network is negligible - while they don't add
any resources to the net, they don't take much away either.
The network routes around these users, and peers only bother
to attempt routing their tunnels through those other peers
who *do* have excess bandwidth.

There is no rational cause for someone who only needs a
basic level of anonymity (e.g. for illicit copying of bits)
but still wants high throughput to want longer tunnels.

Now, the scenario where the user needs better anonymity but
still wants higher throughput, they must be made to
understand that they simply *can't get* better anonymity
unless they route other people's traffic.  Its a functional
necessity for dealing with powerful adversaries, since
otherwise their traffic sticks out like a sore thumb.

<h3>How do I know that I'm talking with who I'm trying to talk with?</h3>

<p>I2P is "cryptographically addressed" - meaning when you try to talk to
someone, you are trying to talk to whomever has their cryptographic 
private key.  In addition, everything is end to end encrypted.  No one - 
not even your local router - knows the contents of what you send to 
them (unless 2048bit ElGamal is broken). </p>
